<h3 class='c005'>Acknowledgments</h3>

<p class='c006'>In a real sense, this book is an acknowledgment to all who
have had a part in shaping my life and being. Since their
names appear only incidentally and accidentally—if at
all—in the course of the text, I hope with all my heart
that they will accept this collective note of gratitude for
all their help.</p>

<p class='c007'>In particular, however, I wish to mention Hardwick
Moseley for his encouragement when the going was
rough; Milton Gilbert who made the Seven Stairs possible
in the first place; Henry Dry, one of the few men I know
who understand the meaning of forbearance; Goldie and
Kalmin Levin (Jennie’s mother and father) for their devotion
and unfailing help; Robert Parrish for his blue penciling;
and Hope, who after giving birth to our son,
Joseph, tenderly cared for the unstrung father through the
pangs of giving birth to <i>The Seven Stairs</i>.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>I might as well tell you what this book is about.</p>

<p class='c014'>Years ago I started to write a memoir about a young
fellow who wanted to be a book dealer and how he made
out. I tore it up when I discovered the subject had
already been covered by a humorist named Will Cuppy
in a book called, <i>How to Become Extinct</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now I’m not so sure. I’m still around in my middle-aged
obsolescence and all about us the young are withering
on the vine. Civilization may beat me yet in achieving
the state of the dodo. The tragedy is that so few seem to
know or really believe it. Maybe there just isn’t enough
innocence left to join with the howl of the stricken book
dealer upon barging into the trap. Not just a howl of self-pity,
but the yap of the human spirit determined to assert
itself no matter what. There’s some juice in that spirit
yet, or there would be no point in submitting the following
pages as supporting evidence—hopefully, or bitterly,
or both.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Let there be no doubt about my original qualifications
for the role of Candide. With three hundred dollars worth
of books (barely enough to fill five shelves), a used record
player, and some old recordings (left in my apartment
when I went into the army and still there upon my
return), I opened the Seven Stairs Book and Record Shop
on the Near North Side of Chicago.</p>

<p class='c014'>The shop was located in one of the old brownstone, converted
residences still remaining on Rush Street—a fashionable
townhouse district in the era after the Great
Chicago Fire, now the kind of a district into which fashionable
townhouses inevitably decline. One had to climb
a short flight of stairs above an English basement (I
thought there were seven steps—in reality there were
eight), pass through a short, dark hall, and unlock a door
with a dime store skeleton key before entering finally into
the prospective shop. It was mid-August of 1946 when I
first stood there in the barren room. The sun had beaten
in all day and I gasped for air; and gasping, I stood wondering
if this was to be the beginning of a new life and an
end to the hit-or-miss of neither success nor failure that
summed up my career to the moment.</p>

<p class='c014'>It all fitted my mood perfectly: the holes in the plaster,
the ripped molding, the 1890 light fixture that hung by
blackened chains from the ceiling, the wood-burning fireplace,
the worn floor, the general air of decay lurking in
every corner. Long before the scene registered fully upon
my mind, it had entered into my emotions. I saw everything
and forgave everything. It could all be repaired,
painted, cleaned—set right with a little work. I saw the
little room filled with books and records, a fire going, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>myself in a velvet jacket, seated behind a desk, being
charming and gracious to everyone who came in.</p>

<p class='c014'>I saw success, excitement, adventure, in the world I
loved—the world of books and music. I saw fine people
coming and going—beautiful women and handsome
men. I saw myself surrounded by warmth, friendship
and good feeling, playing my favorite recordings all day,
telling my favorite stories, finding myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I ran my fingers over the mantelpiece. “I want this
room,” I said to myself. “I want it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I built shelves to the ceiling and bought all the books I
could buy. There was no money left to buy the velvet
jacket. Every morning I opened the store bright and early.
Every night I closed very late. And no one came to visit
me. Morning, noon, and night it was the same. I was
alone with my books and my music. Everything was so
bright, so shiny, so clean. And the books! There were not
very many, but they were all so good! Still nobody came.</p>

<p class='c014'>How do you go about getting people to buy books? I
didn’t know. I had been a teacher before the war. My father
was not a business man either, nor his father. No one
in my family knew anything about business. I knew the
very least.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every morning I walked into the shop freshly determined:
today I will sell a book! I hurried with my housekeeping.
And then, what to do? Phone a friend or a relative.
I couldn’t think of a relative who read or a friend
who wouldn’t see through the thin disguise of my casual
greeting and understand the ulterior purpose of my call.</p>

<p class='c014'>One late afternoon it happened. One of the beautiful
people I had dreamed about <i>came in</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>She stood on the threshold, apparently debating
whether it was safe to venture further. “Is this a bookstore?”
she said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please come in,” I said. “It’s a bookshop.”</p>

<p class='c014'>She was solidly built and had a round face above a
heavy neck with the fat comfortably overlapping the collar
of her white dress. Her legs were sturdy, her feet
were spread in a firm stance, she was fat and strong and
daring.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you have a copy of <i>Peace of Mind</i>?” said my daring
first customer.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everyone was reading the rabbi’s book that summer—except
me. It was a bestseller; naturally I wouldn’t
touch it. But here was a customer!</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lady,” I said, opening my business career on a note of
total capitulation, “if you’ll wait here a moment, I’ll get
the book for you.” She nodded.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please,” I added, running out the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sprinted four blocks to A. C. McClurg’s, the wholesaler
from whom I bought my original three hundred dollars’
worth of books, and bought a single copy of <i>Peace of
Mind</i> for $1.62. Then I ran back to complete my first sale
for $2.50.</p>

<p class='c014'>The realization overwhelmed me that I was totally unprepared
to sell a book. I had no bags or wrapping paper.
I had no cash register or even a cigar box. It seemed
highly improper to accept money and then reach into my
pocket for change. It was a long time, in fact, before I
could get over the embarrassment of taking anyone’s
money at all. I found it very upsetting.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>2</span><br>“Read Your Lease. Goodbye.”</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The near North Side of Chicago is a Greenwich Village,
a slum, and a night life strip bordered by the commerce
of Michigan Boulevard and the Gold Coast homes
and apartments of the wealthy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Into a narrow trough between the down-and-out losers
of Clark Street and the luxurious livers of Lake Shore
Drive flows a stream of life that has no direction, organization,
or established pattern. Here are attracted the inner-directed
ones struggling with their own visions, along
with the hangers-on, the disenchanted and emotionally
bankrupt. It is a haven for the broken soul as well as the
earnest and rebellious. The drug addict, the petty thief,
the sex deviant and the alcoholic are generously mixed
in among the sincere and aspiring. There are the dislocated
wealthy, the connivers and parasites, abortionists
and pimps. There are call girls and crowds of visiting
firemen, second hand clothing stores and smart shops,
pawn brokers and art supply stores.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>Gertrude Stein once wrote about Picasso’s reply to a
young man who was seeking advice on the best location
for opening a Parisian bookstore: “I would just find a
place and start selling books.” Well, I found a place,
uniquely unfavored as a crossroads of commerce (during
the day, virtually no one was on the street), but teeming
with the malcontents, the broken, the battered—the flotsam
and jetsam of urban life, along with inspired or aspiring
prophets, musicians, artists, and writers. What more
could one ask?</p>

<p class='c014'>The original dimensions of the Seven Stairs were fifteen
feet by nine feet. A single bay window looked onto Rush
Street. At the other end of the room stood a small sink.
The bathroom was on the second floor and seldom
worked. Three ashcans on the sidewalk by my window
served the building for garbage disposal. Occasionally
the city emptied them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Across the hall was a hat shop—a blind for a call girl
establishment. The woman who ran it was actually a hat
maker and made hats for her girls. She was a heavy
woman with enormous breasts, who wore immense earrings,
always dressed in black silk, and changed her hair
dye regularly: red, jet black, once silver-grey. She had a
small, bow-shaped mouth, garishly painted, and in the
four years I knew her an improper word never passed her
lips. She was filled with commiseration for cats, at least
a dozen of which wandered in and out of the hall daily.
Once in a while, she would buy a book, always with a fifty
dollar bill, and then was very apologetic for the inconvenience
when I had to run to the drug store for change.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Behind my shop was another studio occupied by a
charming hypochondriacal ballet dancer and a boy
friend who was the tallest, ugliest man I had ever encountered.
Above were two more studios, <a id='corr7.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='occuped'>occupied</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_7.4'>occupied</a></span> by a painter
and a girl who wrote poetry. There were also two studios
on the third floor, but to this day I have no idea who was
there. A bricklayer lived in the basement with his odd and
rather pretty daughter, who had bad teeth, a nervous
tic, and huge, burning black eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Over this assortment of humanity ruled an evil king who
in my reasoned opinion was in fact Mephistopheles in the
guise of a landlord. His life had its meaning in seeing that
the innocent were punished, that neighbors were aroused
to hate and distrust one another, and that needless disaster
always threatened his subjects and often befell them.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was amazing how he could achieve his devilish ends
by the simple incantation, “Read your lease. Goodbye.”
This was his message, whether in the inevitable phone call
when you were a day late with the rent, or in answer to
your call for help when the fuses in the basement blew or
when on a bitter February night the sink broke and the
shop began floating away.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sink affair occurred at a point when my business
had developed to the extent of a few regular accounts
and come to a quiet stalemate. Once these faithful customers
had come in, I was through for the month. I could
scarcely stand the empty hours waiting for someone to
talk with. It was bitter February, cold enough to keep any
sensible soul off the streets. I sat before the fire, filled with
self-pity, my doomed life stretching hopelessly before me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Finally I bestirred myself—and this was my undoing.</p>

<p class='c014'>All I did was throw a carton up to a shelf—a sort of
basketball toss that missed. The box hit the sink, tipped
off, and, incredibly, broke an aged lead water pipe. To
my horror, water began gushing over the floor. I tried
to stuff a towel into the pipe. No good. My beautiful
shop! All the beautiful books! Ruin!</p>

<p class='c014'>Still holding the towel to the pipe with one hand, I
dialed my father’s telephone number. He was a sound
man concerning the mechanical world.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you have a broom?” he said. “All right, cut it in
two and make a plug for the pipe. Then call your landlord.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went to work frantically. All the time water was pouring
across the floor. Finally I managed to whittle a temporary
plug. Then I phoned the landlord.</p>

<p class='c014'>He inquired of my business success.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Please,” I said. “The pipe to the sink has broken. My
store will be ruined. Where is the shut-off?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t know where the shut-off is,” he said. “You are
responsible. Read your lease. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I turned to the City Water Department next. By the
time I explained to them what had happened and they examined
their charts and discovered where the cut-offs
might be located, I was standing in an inch of water.</p>

<p class='c014'>Someone would be over, I was assured. But not right
away. In a few hours perhaps. All the men were out on
emergencies. However, I could try to find the cut-offs myself.
They were outside near the street lamp about a foot
from the curb.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>I stuck my head out the door. It was about ten degrees
above zero, and the ground along the curbing was covered
with at least five inches of ice and snow. What to do?
And all the time, more water was bubbling over the
broom handle and splashing onto the floor.</p>

<p class='c014'>Down at the corner there was a drug store owned by a
man of infinite patience and understanding. No human
act was beyond his comprehension or forgiveness, and he
was always ready to help in moments of crisis. If a girl
needed help, our man at the drug store was there. If she
needed work, legitimate or otherwise, he could find the
spot for her. If a man needed to make a touch, he could
get it without interest. Our druggist was no fence or law
breaker—but he was an answering service, a father confessor,
and an unlikely guardian angel. I ran to him with
my trouble.</p>

<p class='c014'>He looked at me with his sleepy eyes, and, his soft lips
forming quiet assurances, came up with a shovel, an ax,
and a pail of hot water.</p>

<p class='c014'>The problem was where to dig. I went at it blindly, saying
to myself: “Shovel. Shovel. Die if you must. But
shovel.”</p>

<p class='c014'>When I had gotten an area of snow removed, I poured
water over the ice and went at it with the ax. Finally I
struck the top of the box containing the cut-offs and managed
to pry open the lid. There were two knobs in the
box, and having no idea which one related to my store, I
turned them both shut.</p>

<p class='c014'>After returning the hardware to the drug store, I sloshed
back into my inundated establishment and began sweeping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>the water out with what was left of the broom. Working
like a madman, I got most of the water out into the
hall, out the door, and over the stairs, where it froze instantaneously.
Never mind—tomorrow I will chop the
ice away and all will be well.</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time, my strength was exhausted and the shop
was nearly as cold as the outdoors. I felt as though I had
survived some kind of monstrous test. I dumped logs on
the fire, waited until they were ablaze, then stripped off
my wet shoes and socks and wrapped my frozen feet in
my coat.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was sure I had caught pneumonia. I wouldn’t be able
to open the store for weeks. The few accounts I had would
surely be lost. It was the end of everything. How good
it would be if only death would come now, while there
was yet a little warmth to taste in a world which certainly
wanted nothing of my kind.</p>

<p class='c014'>Out of my reverie, I heard a bitter cry. It came from
outside near my door. I jumped up and looked down the
hall. Two men in evening dress were wrestling on the
stairs. The screaming and cursing were awful. At last
they scrambled up and started toward me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You son of a bitch,” one of them cried. “I’ll kill you!”
His fall on the stairs had damaged his suit. Bits of ice had
collected about his long nose, a few even glistened in his
moustache. His hair practically stood on end. Snow and
ice covered his jacket and patched his trousers. His black
tie was crooked and his dress shirt sodden. The other
fellow stared fiercely at me, restraining his partner with
one hand, the other balled into a fist, threatening me.
“Who put you up to this? Why do you want to ruin our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>business? You mother-raping bastard, I’ll cut your
throat!” He took a step forward. I stepped back.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Tell us or we’ll kill you here and now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had never seen these men before in my life. As I retreated
toward my desk, they swept the books off it onto
the wet floor. They sat on the desk and stared at me, and
everything became very quiet.</p>

<p class='c014'>They were proprietors of the restaurant in the corner
building, also owned by my landlord. In shutting off the
water, I had turned off theirs, too. They also had called
the landlord, and he told them that I was undoubtedly responsible.
But he failed to tell them what had been happening
to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now I showed them the broken pipe, the floor still wet
in spots, my hands which were raw and bruised. I picked
up the books from the floor and took off the wet dust jackets.
Here goes my profit for a week, I thought. I could tell
their anger had cooled. Instead of being cruel, they
looked almost contrite. I went outside again in my wet
shoes and socks and coat and turned one of the shut-off
keys. Naturally it was the wrong one. The restaurant
man pounded at the window to attract my attention. I
reversed my switches and restored their precious water.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remained in the shop a while, too exhausted and
heartbroken to leave. Where now, little man? I didn’t
know. But I resolved never to call my landlord again—no
matter what.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a fruitless resolve. One morning two inspectors
from the Fire Department paid me a visit.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are those your logs under the stairs?” one of them
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Those are my logs,” I said. “But they are not under
the stairs. They are by a stone wall near the stairs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That makes no difference. It’s a fire hazard and someone
has filed a complaint. Get the logs out by tomorrow
or we’ll close you up.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered my landlord’s visit a week earlier. He
had commented that I had a good pile of logs which
should make a warm fire. He twirled his cane and looked
at me from cat-grey eyes, set in a flabby yellow face
crushed in a thousand wrinkles. As he minced about on
his tiny feet, encased in patent leather pumps, I expected
any moment to see the walls part or the ceiling open for
his exit. When he left in the normal way, wishing me good
luck and great success, I was sure he doffed his black
homburg to me. Almost sure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now I threw my resolutions to the wind and phoned
him, determined to take the offensive at any cost.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why did you call those fire inspectors?” I demanded.
“Couldn’t you have told me if I was breaking an ordinance?”</p>

<p class='c014'>The more my voice rose, the more he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not long afterward a fat, tobacco chewing sloven entered
the shop and stood looking around carefully, swaying
on the balls of his feet. I thought he might be a tout,
lost on his way to a bookie.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where does this wire go?” he finally asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go?” I said. “Who cares?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Don’t get snotty with me, buddy,” he said. “I’m going
to close you up. I’m the city electrical inspector and we’ve
got a complaint that your wiring is a hazard to the building.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>He continued to stand in the middle of the floor, his
hands locked behind his back, swaying back and forth like
the old Jews on High Holidays in the Synagogue.</p>

<p class='c014'>When he had gone, I called my landlord and cried,
“Listen, you are killing me with inspection. Wish me bad
luck and bankruptcy and leave me alone!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course I had to get an electrical contractor, whose
workmen tore the shop to pieces, removed perfectly good
wiring, and replaced it.</p>

<p class='c014'>A week later a tall man in a Brooks Brothers suit and
carrying an attaché case came to collect the bill for
$375.00. His smugness was so overwhelming that I
turned and walked away from him. As I moved along, inspecting
my bookshelves, he followed closely behind. I
could see myself walking down Rush Street, going to dinner,
going home, with this persistent, immaculate young
man silently in attendance. Suddenly, turning, I stepped
squarely on his polished shoes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Excusing myself, I said, “You know, the man to pay you
for this work is my landlord. If the wiring was faulty between
the walls, obviously I have nothing to do with it.
I’ll call him up. You can talk with him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My landlord must have been surprised at my cheery
voice. “I have an interesting gentleman here who wants
to talk with you,” I said. “He is a genius. The work he did
for you in the installation of BX wires between the walls
is something to be seen to be appreciated. You’ll marvel
at its beauty. Here he is.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I handed over the receiver. The storm of words coming
from the other end nearly blew the young man off his
feet. I couldn’t contain my laughter. I lurched over to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>wall, holding my guts and laughing till I cried. It was
marvelous. Wonderful. I had reversed the tables at last.</p>

<p class='c014'>Naturally, I paid the bill. My landlord had new electrical
outlets, but our relations were different. He continued
to take advantage of me, but not any longer under
the guise of wishing me “good luck” or a “great success.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My landlord helped me. He taught me to be on guard.
He taught me that it is, in fact, cold outside. He put me
on trial—rather like K in Kafka’s <i>The Trial</i>. I could not
just go running for help when trouble came. I could
no longer retreat into the fantasy of pretending that running
a bookstore was not a business. He taught me that
the world requires people to take abuse, lying, cheating,
duplicity—and outlast them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now when my landlord came to visit me, it was on an
entirely new emotional basis. Nothing was different in
appearance, yet in feeling everything was changed because
I was no longer afraid. When he cheated me now,
it was only a cheap triumph for him. I was free because I
had become inwardly secure. I did not beat the Devil, but
I knew positively that the Devil exists, that evil is real.
Let him do his worst—his absolute worst—so long as
you can handle yourself, he cannot ultimately triumph.
Where K failed in <i>The Trial</i> was in his emotional inability
to handle his threatened ego.</p>

<p class='c014'>K’s trial is allegorical. So was my landlord. Only with
the imagination can we see through into what is real. My
landlord was one of the disguises of evil. I know
now that had I let him throw me, I could never have withstood
the trials of reality that were to come.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>3</span><br>How to Get Started<br>in the Book Business</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I had decided to become a bookseller because I loved
good books. I assumed there must be many others who
shared a love for reading and that I could minister to their
needs. I thought of this as a calling. It never occurred to
me to investigate bookselling as a business.</p>

<p class='c014'>Had I done so, I should have learned that eighty percent
of all the hardcover books purchased across the counter
in America are sold by twenty booksellers. If I had
been given the facts and sat down with pencil and paper,
I could have discovered that to earn a living and continue
to build the kind of inventory that would make it possible
to go on selling, I would need to have an annual gross in
the neighborhood of $100,000!</p>

<p class='c014'>Even if I had had the facts in hand, they would
not have deterred me. If vows of poverty were necessary,
I was ready to take them. And I refused to be distressed
by the expressions on people’s faces when I confided that
I was about to make a living selling books. Sell freight,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>yes. Sell bonds or stocks or insurance, certainly. Sell pots
and pans. But books!</p>

<p class='c014'>And I was not only going to sell books—I was going to
sell <i>real</i> books: those that dealt seriously and truly with
the spirit of man.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had finished cleaning and decorating my little shop
before it dawned on me that I did not know how to go
about the next step: getting a stock of books and records
to sell. A study of the classified telephone directory revealed
the names of very few publishers that sounded at
all familiar. Was it possible there were no publishers in
Chicago? If that were the case, would I have to go
to New York?</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a telephone listing for Little, Brown and
Company, so I called them. The lady there said she would
be glad to see me. She proved to be very kind and very
disillusioning.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” she said, “the book business is not easy, and your
location is bad. No, the big publishers will not sell to you
direct because your account is too small. No, we at Little,
Brown won’t either. If I were you, I’d forget the whole
idea and go back to teaching.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Everything was No. But she did tell me where I could
buy books of all publishers wholesale, and that was the information
I wanted. I hastened to A. C. McClurg’s and
presented myself to the credit manager.</p>

<p class='c014'>The fact that I had a shop, nicely decorated, did not
seem to qualify me for instant credit. First I would have
to fill out an application and await the results of an investigation.
In the meantime if I wanted books, I could
buy them for cash.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>“All right,” I said. “I want to buy three hundred dollars
worth of books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“That isn’t very much,” the man said. “How big is your
store?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I said, “it’s fifteen feet long and nine feet wide,
and I’m going to carry records, too.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He shook his head and, with a sidewise glance, asked,
“What did you say your name was?” Then, still apparently
somewhat shattered, he directed me to a salesman.</p>

<p class='c014'>I launched into my buying terribly, terribly happy,
yet filled with all sorts of misgivings. Was I selecting the
right books? And who would I sell them to? But I had
only to touch their brand new shiny jackets to restore my
confidence. I remember buying Jules Romain’s <i>Men of
Good Will</i>. In fifteen years, I never sold a copy. I’m still
trying. I bought Knut Hamson, Thomas Mann, Sigrid
Undset, Joseph Hergesheimer, Willa Cather, Henry James—as
much good reading as I could obtain for $298.49. I
was promised delivery as soon as the check cleared.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the books arrived on a Saturday morning, it
was like a first love affair. I waited breathlessly as the
truck drew up, full of books for my shop. It wasn’t full
at all, of course—not for me, anyway. My books were
contained in a few modest boxes. And I had built shelves
all the way up to the ceiling!</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, a moment of panic. Enough, my heart said.
Stay in the dream! What’s next?</p>

<p class='c014'>The next step was to get recordings. In this field, at
least, I found that all the major companies had branch offices
in Chicago. I called Columbia records and was told
they’d send me a salesman.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>He arrived a few days later, blue eyed and blond
haired, an interesting man with a sad message. “No, we
can’t open you up,” he said. “It’s out of the question. Your
store is in direct conflict with Lyon and Healy on the Avenue.
So there’s no question about it, we can’t give you a
franchise. We won’t. Decca won’t. And I’m sure RCA
won’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was overcome with rage. Didn’t he know I had fought
to keep this country free? Wasn’t there such a thing as
free enterprise? Didn’t I have a right to compete in a decent
and honorable manner? If I couldn’t get records one
way, I’d get them another, I assured him. Strangely
enough, he seemed to like my reaction. Later he was able
to help me.</p>

<p class='c014'>But for the present, I was reduced to borrowing more
money from my brother-in-law with which to buy off-beat
recordings from an independent distributor. I brought
my own phonograph from home and my typewriter and
settled down to the long wait for the first customer.</p>

<p class='c014'>How do you get going in a business of which you have
no practical knowledge and which inherently is a doomed
undertaking to begin with? The only answer is that you
must be favored with guardian angels.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first one to bring a flutter of hope into my life came
into it on a September afternoon at a luncheon affair, under
I do not know what auspices, for Chicago authors.
There I encountered a distinguished looking white-haired
gentleman, tall but with the sloping back of a literary man,
standing mildly in a corner. I introduced myself to Vincent
Starrett, bibliophile and Sherlock Holmes scholar.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>He listened attentively to my account of myself and took
my phone number. A few days later he called to ask for
more information about my idea of combining the sale
of books and records.</p>

<p class='c014'>I pointed out that it was easy, for example, to sell a copy
of Ibsen’s <i>Peer Gynt</i> if the customer was familiar with
Grieg’s incidental music for the play. Besides, reading
and listening were closely allied activities. Anyone with
literary tastes could or should have equivalent tastes in
music. It was logical to sell a record at the same time you
sold a book. Mr. Starrett thought this was a fine idea, and
to my shocked surprise, wrote a paragraph about me in his
column in the Book Section of the <i>Chicago Sunday Tribune</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Monday after the write-up appeared, I could hardly
wait to get to the shop. I expected it would be flooded
with people. It wasn’t. The phone didn’t even ring. I
was disappointed, but still felt that hidden forces were
working in the direction of my success. Mr. Starrett’s
kind words were a turning point for me—I no longer felt
anonymous.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some people did see the write-up—intelligent, charming,
good people, such as I had imagined gathering in my
tiny premises. Among them were two young women who
were commercial artists. One day they complained that
there was nothing in the store to sit on, and after I had
stumbled for excuses, they presented me with a bench
decorated on either side with the inscriptions: “Words
and Music by Stuart Brent,” and “Time Is Well Spent with
Stuart Brent.” Now I felt sure things were looking up.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>My next good genie and an important influence in my
life was a short, bald gentleman with horn-rimmed spectacles
who stood uncertainly in the doorway and asked,
“Where’s the shop?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He was Ben Kartman, then Associate Editor of <i>Coronet
Magazine</i>, a man as kind and thoughtful as he is witty and
urbane. He came in and looked around, studied the
empty shelves, and shook his head. He shook his head
often that afternoon. He wondered if I was seriously trying
to be a bookseller—or was I just a dreamer with a
hideout?</p>

<p class='c014'>Surely I wanted to survive, didn’t I? Surely I wanted
to sell books. Well, in that case, he assured me, I was going
about it all wrong. For one thing, I had no sign. For
another, I had no books in the windows. And most important
of all, I had no stock. How can you do business
without inventory? You can’t sell apples out of an empty
barrel.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took all his comments without a sound.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Ben said, “Sunday come out to the house. I’ve
got a lot of review copies as well as old but saleable books.
Even if you don’t sell them, put them on the shelves. The
store will look more prosperous.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He gave me several hundred books from his library,
which we hauled to the store in his car. The Seven Stairs
began to look like a real bookshop.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ben Kartman also decided that I needed publicity. Not
long afterward, my name appeared in a daily gossip
column in one of the Chicago newspapers. Ben said that
these daily puffers could be important to me, and this
proved to be the case.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>Meshing with my association with Kartman was another
significant influence—a man who certainly altered my
life and might have changed it still more had he lived. He
was Ric Riccardo, owner of a famous restaurant a quarter
of a mile down the street from my shop, and one of the
most extraordinary and magnetic personalities I have ever
encountered. He was an accomplished artist, but it was
his fire, his avid love of life, his utterly unfettered speech
and manner, his infatuation both with physical being and
ideas that drew the famous and the somewhat famous and
the plain hangers-on constantly to his presence. He is the
only great romantic character I have known.</p>

<p class='c014'>He first came into my store one day before Christmas.
He wore a Cossack fur hat and a coat with a huge mink
collar and held a pair of Great Danes on a leash. He had
the physique of Ezio Pinza and the profile (not to mention
more than a hint of the bags beneath the eyes) of his
friend, the late John Barrymore. He was tremendous. He
told me all he wanted was some light reading to get his
mind off his troubles.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later when Riccardo and the Danes entered the shop,
virtually filling it, I would stand on a chair to converse
with him. He was very tall and it gave me a better chance
to observe him. Although his language was often coarse,
he shunned small talk or fake expressions. The only time
he ever reprimanded me was the day I used the phrase,
“I’ve got news for you.” As our friendship became firm, I
would often join him after closing the store for a bowl of
green noodles (still a great specialty of the restaurant
which is now managed by his son).</p>

<p class='c014'>Now if, as Ben said, I did everything wrong, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>at least one thing I certainly did not neglect to do. I
talked to people. I knew my books and I knew what I
was talking about. Ideas were and are living things to
me and objects of total enthusiasm. It hurt me terribly
if someone came in and asked for a book without letting
me talk with him about it. The whole joy of selling a book
was in talking about the ideas in it. It was a matter of
sharing my life and my thought and my very blood stream
with others. <i>That</i> was why I had been impelled into this
mad venture—unrelated to any practical consideration
beyond enthusiasm for the only things that seemed to me
to be meaningful. Ric was one of those who responded
to this enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c014'>One very cold February morning, a cab stopped outside
the shop. I saw two men and a woman get out and
come up the stairs. There was a good fire going in the fireplace
and it was quiet and warm inside.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ric was the only member of the trio I recognized, although
the other man looked at me as though I should
know him. But the woman! She wore the longest, most
magnificent mink coat I had ever seen, the collar partially
turned up about her head. When she spoke, I backed
away, but she stepped in and extended her hand to me. It
was Katharine Hepburn.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, yes, that’s Katie,” the unidentified man said, and
all of them laughed at my obvious confusion. Miss Hepburn
sat on my decorated bench and held out her hands
to the fire.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ric said, “Stuart, my boy, this is Luther Adler.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was too nervous to say anything as we shook hands.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>I could only keep staring at Katharine Hepburn. I adored
her. I loved her accent and those cheek bones and that
highly charged voice. I wanted so much to do something
for her but I couldn’t think of anything to do.</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly Ric said, “Let’s buy some books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Mr. Adler looked about and said, “Do you have a book
for a Lost Woman?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I said, “Yes,” and handed him a copy of Ferdinand
Lundberg’s new book, <i>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</i>. He
gave it to Miss Hepburn, saying, “Here, Katie, this is for
you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without a pause, she turned and said, “Do you have a
good book for a Lost Jew?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes,” I said, and produced a Sholem Asch volume.</p>

<p class='c014'>She gave it to Mr. Adler, saying, “Here, Luther, this is
for you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>They bought many books that morning, and I was
swept away in wonder and exhilaration at the possibility
of bringing happiness to Lost Women, Lost Jews, the
Beautiful and the Great, alike in their needs with all of
us for the strength and joy of the spirit. It was wonderful—but
it was awful when I had to take their money.</p>

<p class='c014'>A world very much like that of my dreams began to
open up. People came. Authors began to congregate
around the fireplace. The shop was visited by newspaper
writers like Martha King, of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, who
wrote a charming article, for which I was deeply grateful.
I was beginning to do business, although still without
a cash register. The rent was paid promptly, and
McClurg’s permitted me to have a charge account. One
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>or two Eastern publishers even let me have some books
on open account. And the man from Columbia Records
kept dropping by, leading me to believe that they might
be thinking about me in spite of their presumed obligations
to Lyon and Healy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why did people come, often far out of their way and at
considerable inconvenience? I was too busy to reflect
upon the matter at the time. There was nothing there but
the books and me—and a great deal of talk. But some
need must have been filled—by moving people to take
notice of themselves, forcing them to think about what
they were reading or what they were listening to. We
talked a lot of small talk, too, but it was small talk with
heart in it. And the effect was contagious. Those who
came told others and they came too.</p>

<p class='c014'>The place acquired a life of its own, which will be the
subject of many of the following pages. But that life, real
and wonderful as it was, could not endure. Perhaps it is
worth writing about because it is <i>not</i> a success story—and
what came after has its meaning in the reflected tenderness
and flickering hope those years taught one to
cherish.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is not merely a sentimental record. It has no point
unless seen against the background of the cultural poverty
of our society—and the apparent economic impossibility
of alleviating that poverty through commercial
channels such as the publication and distribution of books.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plain fact is, the kind of business I wanted to immerse
myself in does not exist. One of the reasons it does
not exist is because the publishing industry does not—and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>quite possibly cannot—support it, even to the extent
of supplying its reason for being: good books. The
business of publishing and the profession of letters have
become worlds apart. The arts are being bereft of their
purpose through a horrifying operation known as “the
communications industry,” an industry geared for junk
eaters.</p>

<p class='c014'>Publishing is “bigger” and more profitable today than
ever before, largely because of the mushrooming of educational
institutions and the consequent demand for textbooks.
Wall Street has gone into publishing; there is
money in it. But the money is in mass distribution—through
the schools, through the book clubs. It is little
wonder that the individual, personal bookseller is an
anachronism, lost sight of by the publishers themselves.
The bookseller may feel outraged, as I did, when a publisher
sells him books, then sends out a mailing piece to
the bookseller’s customers offering the same books at a
much lower price. The practice is certainly unfair, but
the bookseller has become a completely vestigial distributing
organ. What the publisher is really looking forward
to is the possibility that one of the book clubs will take
some of his publications, further slashing the price beyond
the possibility of retail competition.</p>

<p class='c014'>And what of the writer? If he can turn out bestsellers,
he can live like a potentate. But the sure-fire formula in
this field is to pander to a sex-starved culture and a dirty,
vulgar one to boot. A book written by this or any other
formula can’t be worth anything. A true book must be
part of the individual’s life and spirit.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>It is commonplace to blame the public for what the
public gets. And no doubt the public must take the blame.
But I am not interested in giving the public what it wants
if this means corrupting man’s spirit even through as ineffectual
a medium as the printed word.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a matter of fact, I have never had what people
wanted to read (“Your competitor just bought fifty copies
of this title,” the publisher’s representative would tell me,
shaking his head hopelessly), and I lost out because of it.
But my personal satisfaction derived from recommending
some book, possibly an old one, that I thought would
bring the reader something fresh and real.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anything that touches the heart or stirs the mind has
become a matter for apology. I think of Mary Martin
coming out on the stage in <i>South Pacific</i> and begging the
audience’s indulgence and forgiveness for having to admit
to them that she was in love with a wonderful guy!</p>

<p class='c014'>Is it any wonder that modern men and women are so
threatened, frightened, and weak when they have lost the
capacity for love, tenderness and awe—capacities which
should be nourished by what we read? And especially
the men. “Where are the men?” the women ask. Once a
man has joined “the organization,” the love of a real
woman offers a basic threat. The organization man
doesn’t want to be challenged by a relationship any more
than by an idea.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was to these deficiencies in people’s lives that I had
hoped to minister. Reading remains a positive leverage
to keep us from becoming dehumanized. But easy reading
won’t do it, or phony Great Book courses that foster smugness
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>and an assumed superiority (read the ads purveying
this kind of intellectual snobbery).</p>

<p class='c014'>We can’t go on devaluating the human spirit and expect
some miracle to save us. Even Moses couldn’t get
the Red Sea to divide until a stranger acted upon absolute
faith and jumped in. I felt my job was to get people to
jump—to read something, old or new, that could engage
them in some real vision of human possibilities: to read Albert
Camus or Graham Greene or Rollo May or Erich
Fromm. To read again (or for the first time) Ibsen’s <i>Peer
Gynt</i> or Kafka’s <i>The Trial</i>, Bruno Bettleheim’s <i>The Informed
Heart</i>, F. S. C. Northrop’s <i>Philosophical Anthropology</i>,
or Father duChardin’s <i>The Phenomena of Man</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>I decided I could sell a good book just as easily as a bad
book. In the days following the visit of Katharine Hepburn,
I placed <i>Modern Woman: The Lost Sex</i> into the
hands of many women, and the responses were gratifying
and illuminating. Finally I wrote a letter to Ferdinand
Lundberg, co-author of the book, telling him of one
of the most interesting of these incidents. He sent the letter
along to Mary Griffiths, then advertising manager for
Harper and Brothers, who asked permission to reprint it
in its entirety as an ad in the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> book section.
A phenomenal sale resulted. I sold hundreds of
copies and so did other Chicago booksellers.</p>

<p class='c014'>It looked as though things were opening up for me, as
though I might be on the way toward proving my point.
And perhaps something was proved. Much later when
in a state of great depression I wrote a gloomy letter to
Hardwick Moseley, sales manager of Houghton Mifflin,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>he responded by saying, “Never will I permit you to leave
the book business. If we had fifty more like you in the
United States we might have a business!” But for so many
reasons, some of which I have just dwelt on, the odds
against fifty such enterprises flowering—or any of them
flourishing—are very, very great.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meantime, however, several colorful years of the Seven
Stairs lay ahead, and, beyond that, an unimagined range
of encounter in the diverse realms of art and letters,
psychiatry, commerce, and, that monster of the age, television.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>4</span><br>Building the Seven Stairs</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>You’d be surprised how humiliating it can be to wrap
books in cramped quarters.</p>

<p class='c014'>As business grew, Saturday afternoon became a great
but soul-shattering time for me. The shop was filled with
people, music, conversation. There was the delicious thrill
of selling, tarnished still by the dubious proposition of
taking money, and followed finally by the utter physical
subjugation of package wrapping. One moment I was riding
a wave of spiritual exhilaration; the next moment I
was the contorted victim of some degrading seizure as I
grappled with paper and twine while people pressed
about me. The shop was too small!</p>

<p class='c014'>Ben Kartman had constantly encouraged me to expand.
But expand where? Well, there was a back room
occupied by a dancer who had given up his career
because of a psychotic fear of travel. It was a fine, big
room, and it too had a fireplace. He was very friendly and
I had helped him find a bit of solace through Havelock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>Ellis’ <i>The Dance of Life</i>. The only course now seemed to
be to persuade him to move into one of the vacant studios
upstairs. This proved not difficult to do so far as he was
concerned, but what of our landlord?</p>

<p class='c014'>So again I was calling my landlord, and with his voice
dripping with its usual sweetness he invited me to come
right over.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all just the same, the little patent leather shoes,
the pin striped trousers, the pearl grey vest, the stickpin
in the tie, the waxed moustache, the mincing steps across
the thick rugs of the rich, imperious, and somewhat decayed
quarters. There was the same circuitous conversation
with a thousand extraneous asides, but somehow it
resulted in my signing a two-year lease for the doubled
space. And this time I didn’t even need a co-signer. My
landlord felt sure my success was as good as made.</p>

<p class='c014'>I firmly believed I was on my way, too. I had suffered
and nearly broken more than once, but the dream
was working. I was building a store with love in it.
I wasn’t merely selling books—I was teaching. And in
my awesome love for books, every package of fresh, new
volumes, cold and virginal to the touch, shining with invitation,
returned my devotion with a sensuous thrill. In
discovering this world, I felt I had discovered myself. I
had been tested, and the future was open before me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, I had no money. But I was young, my nervous
system could take endless punishment, my stomach
could digest anything, and I could sleep on a rock. Beholden
to no one, I hit upon a principle: If an idea is psychologically
sound, it must be economically feasible.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>Now I was sure. The breakthrough was more than the
penetration of a wall into another room. It would be a
breakthrough for my heart and a new beginning in my
life.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first thing to do was to bring in a building contractor.
He surveyed the situation and assured me that the
job was simple—two men could do it in a week. It would
cost about one thousand dollars.</p>

<p class='c014'>Well what about it? Of course all of my profits were
tied up in increased stock, but I was certainly not going
to let money check my enthusiasm at this point. The time
had come, I decided, to see about a bank. Every day
while riding the bus I saw signs offering me money on my
signature only. Do you want a new car? Need to pay old
bills? Buy a car? Buy a refrigerator? Buy anything?
See your friendly banker. What really decent fellows
these bankers must be!</p>

<p class='c014'>I had also been told at the separation center that as a
former soldier I was entitled to certain kinds of help from
a grateful government, which included financial backing
in any promising business venture. I could not see anything
standing seriously in the way of my borrowing a
thousand dollars for my breakthrough.</p>

<p class='c014'>Therefore, bright and early on a fine morning, I went
to the bank. I had dressed myself with care. My tie was
straight and my shirt clean. I wore my only suit. My shoes
were shined. I had shaved carefully and brushed my hair
with purpose. After all, I reasoned, a banker is a banker—you
must respect him. I had never known a banker before
in my life, and I scare easily.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>When I sat down with the bank officer, I was glad I had
taken care to make a good impression, for he looked me
over while I stated my business. Apparently his mind
was not on my attire, however.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you carry life insurance?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you have a car?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, sir.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you have stocks or bonds?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt slightly ill. No one in my entire life had ever mentioned
stocks or bonds to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Then what will you do for collateral?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again a word no one had ever used in front of me.</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried another tack. “I believe I ought to tell you more
about myself.” Then my voice dried up. Tell him what?
That when I was in college, I learned the <i>Ode to the West
Wind</i> by heart? That I believed in the impossible? That
I would rather die than fail to meet an obligation to his
bank? It would never do ... not for this man with the
pale, hard eyes.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was not unkind to me. He pointed to a little, old
lady across the floor and said, “Now suppose that woman
making a deposit were told that I made a loan to you of
one thousand dollars without the security of any collateral,
do you know what she could do? She could have
me fired for jeopardizing her savings.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I didn’t have the heart to ask about the happy signs in
the buses, but grasped at one last straw. “Isn’t it a fact,”
I said, “that the government will guarantee this kind of
loan if I can show justification for it?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>He admitted this was correct. “But we’d rather not
make that kind of loan,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>That was twelve years ago. Today the banks are generous
and I can get a loan without shining my shoes or
straightening my tie. The answer is terribly simple. Banks
only loan money to those who already have it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I walked defeated along Michigan Avenue under the
cloudless sky. It was all so simple, logical, and perfectly
mechanical. I just couldn’t make something out of nothing,
no matter how strong my will or how deep my faith.
I had to have money.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I walked, a comment of my father’s flitted through
my mind: “Some men make it early in life, but you, my
son, will make it a little late in life. But you’ll make it.” I
said to myself, “Look, nothing has changed. Nothing at
all. If you don’t expand, what of it? Are you beginning
to think of the kind of success that feeds the infantile
longings of so many adults? What’s wrong with what
you’ve accomplished?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered going to my father to talk about college.
“Go to college,” he told me. “It is very important to get
a college education. I’m right behind you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It takes money to go to college,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Money?” he said. “What fool can’t go to college with
money? The idea is to make it without money!”</p>

<p class='c014'>And so I did.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was feeling better when I reached the shop, but was
still so deep in my soliloquy that I rested my head on the
desk and did not even hear Ben Kartman’s steps when he
came up the stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“What’s the trouble, Stuart?” he said, standing in the
doorway looking at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I went to the bank,” I told him. “They turned me
down. I’m a poor credit risk and they never heard of
World War II, believe me. So there’ll be no expansion.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How much will the construction cost?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But you’ll need some more money for stock and to fix
the place up, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I guess so.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well?” He began to laugh while I talked my problem
out. Finally he stopped laughing and I stopped talking.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Get your hat and come with me,” he said. “I’ll get you
the money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We went to the bank together. Ben signed the notes
with his house as collateral. I got the money and the
breakthrough began. But I owed the bank two thousand
dollars! I no longer slept so well.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anyway, down went the partition and the Seven Stairs
expanded. Joe Reiner, then sales representative for
Crown Publishers, happened in and, observing that I
needed more book shelving, took me to see Dorothy Gottlieb,
who was moving her Gold Coast <a id='corr34.32'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='book store'>bookstore</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_34.32'>bookstore</a></span> to the
Ambassador East Hotel. She had plenty of shelving to
sell.</p>

<p class='c014'>On a Sunday morning, Joe and I got a mover to bring
in the new fixtures. We came puffing and grunting in
with the shelving and nearly annihilated my sick ballet
dancer, who was supposed to have moved out a week before.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>He lay on a mattress in the middle of the floor and,
upon seeing us, let out a yell and drew the blankets up
to his chin, crying, “What do you think this is? A Frank
Capra movie? Here I lie on my virtuous couch, too ill to
move, and you...!”</p>

<p class='c015'>I developed several successful techniques for selling
books. For example, when I read a book that I liked very
much, I would send out a post card to everyone I believed
might be interested in it also. There is not much room on
a post card, so the words describing the value of the book
had to be selected carefully. I avoided the dust jacket
phrases. “Great,” “brilliant,” and “exciting” won’t cut any
mustard. You must know your book and know your mailing
list.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another technique was the use of the phone call—a
very delicate tool that must not be employed indiscriminately.
The call must, first of all, be made to someone who
you are reasonably sure won’t resent it. And you must
know exactly what to say and say it quickly.</p>

<p class='c014'>When a friend came into the store, I might greet him
with “Ah, guter brudder, glad you stopped in. I have a
book for you.” Or, “Here is a new Mozart recording you
must hear.”</p>

<p class='c014'>To have a successful book store means also to be a slave
to detail. This I found killing. Often I would struggle for
hours to track down a title someone had requested, go to
the trouble of ordering it (more often than not on a
money in advance basis), only to find that the customer
no longer wanted the book. Or I would special order a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>book, run like a demented fool over to the customer’s office
to deliver it personally, and discover that the wrong
book had been ordered in the first place. You could pretend
to yourself that this kind of service would endear you
to the customer and cement a faithful relationship, but it
didn’t always work that way.</p>

<p class='c014'>I worked hard, but my customer relations were not always
perfect. I demanded that customers buy books for
the same reasons that I sold them—out of a serious regard
for greatness. I could not stand having myself or
my books and records treated as a toy by the jaded and
self-satisfied. And I was a jealous god. Today I know better,
yet I instinctively back away from a customer who
comes into the store carrying a package from another
bookseller.</p>

<p class='c014'>But well or poorly done, it took all kinds of doing: typing
post cards, making phone calls, washing and sweeping
the floor, cleaning the windows and shelves, running
to the post office, delivering books, and talking in the
meanwhile on the mind of Spinoza, the beauty of the Mozart
D Minor Quartet, the narrative power of Hemingway,
or the value of <i>The Caine Mutiny</i>, which on first appearance
was slow to catch on.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, the business was developing. Each day I met
someone new. Each day presented new challenges to
one’s strength and intuition and pure capacity for survival.
Around this struggle there developed a convivial
circle which was ample reward for anything. On any Saturday
afternoon it might include Nelson Algren, Jack
Conroy, Studs Terkel, Ira Blitzsten, Dr. Harvey Lewis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>Marvin Spira, Evelyn Mayer, David Brooks and Dr. Robert
Kohrman, holding forth on an inexhaustible range of
subjects, filling the air with tobacco smoke, drinking
fiercely strong coffee from sometimes dirty cups, and
munching salami and apples. The world of the Seven
Stairs was beginning to form.</p>

<p class='c015'>For months I practically made a career of selling Nelson
Algren’s neglected volume of short stories, <i>The Neon
Wilderness</i>. Nelson had already received considerable
acclaim for the book, as well as his already published novels,
<i>Somebody in Boots</i> and <i>Never Come Morning</i>, but
short stories don’t sell (it is said). In any event, these
stories represent some of Algren’s finest work (which at
its best is very fine indeed), and I placed the book in the
hands of everyone who came into the shop. I sold hundreds
of copies. Then to keep the book alive, we held
periodic parties. One month we would call it Nelson’s
birthday, another month the birthday of the publication
of the book, still another the birthday of the book itself.
We invariably invited many of the same people, along
with new prospects. At one point, Ira Blitzsten was
moved to remark that he didn’t want Nelson to autograph
his copy as he wanted the distinction of being the only
person in Chicago with an unsigned copy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Algren is a tall, lanky individual with mussed blond
hair and a sensitive face, sometimes tight and drawn,
<a id='corr37.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='some times'>sometimes</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_37.31'>sometimes</a></span> relaxed. In those days he wore steel rimmed spectacles
and Clark Street clothes—a pin stripe suit, a garish
shirt, a ridiculous tie, in spite of which he still had a fairly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>conservative bearing. Once he even wore a bow tie that
lit up.</p>

<p class='c014'>He is a quiet man. You sense he has a temper, but he
seldom uses it. He is an authority on the argot of the “wild
side of the street,” and I never heard him utter a vulgar
word. He has the faculty of putting others at ease. When
he talks with you, he gives you a remarkable singleness of
attention. Even if the room is overflowing with people,
you know that he is listening only to you.</p>

<p class='c014'>He is a loner who reveals nothing of his private life. In
fact, he never gave me his address. When he is introduced
to someone, he shakes hands and nods his head at the
same time. He gives you the simultaneous impression of
understanding and remoteness. You are not surprised to
find that his humor is sardonic.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nelson Algren and Jack Conroy could perform a remarkable
duet on the subject of James T. Farrell, Conroy
in a broad Irish accent, Algren in a clipped, half muttering
manner. I never learned the personal source of their
animosity, but the name of Farrell had the magic to channel
all their hostilities and frustrations into a fountain of
pure malice. It was wonderful.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes Nelson brought his mother. Sometimes he
would bring with him one of the girls related to the novel
he was then writing, <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i>. One
night Nelson took me to “the wild side.” We entered
a Clark Street tavern, a long, bare hall perhaps 150 feet
long and thirty feet wide. Along one wall stretched a
huge bar. It was a busy evening—every stool was occupied.
We crossed the wooden floor to the other side of
the room where there were rows of small tables with folding
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>chairs set around them. Before we were seated, one
of the men at the bar slugged his woman in the mouth,
and the two fell off their stools, blood gushing, and
landed, one on top of the other on the floor. The bartenders
came around and dragged them out, pitching
them into the street.</p>

<p class='c014'>A moment later one of the bartenders was at our table
asking for our order. He knew Nelson, and they chatted
easily. I was, frankly, sniffing, for as the stale beer smell
of the place settled, I had a sense of being literally in a
zoo.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I looked about, I observed a mesh of wire fencing
across the section of the ceiling beneath which we were
sitting. I got up and inspected. There above us were live
monkeys sitting on a bar behind the fence. I sat down
and asked Nelson what this meant.</p>

<p class='c014'>He said, “Wait and see.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The tavern din was terrible, a demonic blend of shouting,
laughing, swearing, name-calling—the human cries
at inhuman pitch. It was out of a Gorky novel.</p>

<p class='c014'>We drank several beers and waited, talking very little.
Nelson’s face seemed fixed in a slight smile of playful disdain.
It was impossible to say of what.</p>

<p class='c014'>My bafflement was intensified when two men walked
in and approached the place where we were sitting. They
pulled a ladder from the wall, climbed the steps, and
opened the door of one of the cages. One of the men took
a monkey by the leather strap attached to its collar,
placed it on his back, and climbed down the ladder. He
walked to the far end of the room, opened a door, went in,
and closed the door after him and his companion.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>I sat rooted to my seat, failing to understand what I
had seen. Was this in some way the meaning behind the
phrase, “a monkey on his back”? I knew that whatever
was going on here could scarcely be an idle zoological
experiment, yet somehow I felt an impenetrable wall between
my innocence and the full possibilities of human
depravity.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked once more at the people in the tavern, and all
at once it was with different eyes. I no longer saw them as
“dregs” and “strays.” I saw something terrible, humiliating,
too outrageous to form into words.</p>

<p class='c014'>What is happening? Who are these people? Are they,
indeed, people? But am I? Have I an identity?</p>

<p class='c014'>My smugness melted and the distaste I had felt for
what I saw now angered me. I had come into this place
small, mean, and superior, a cad and a fop, the epitome of
what I had long viewed with scorn in others.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had a better notion of what Nelson was seeing and
the nature of his protest. He had shown me a world where
people lived without choice or destination.</p>

<p class='c014'>I lived for days with this nightmare, asking myself why
I should feel guilt for those who no longer feel responsible
for themselves. Then it occurred to me that the question
was never one of guilt, but only of love. The agony exists
regardless of the setting. The lack of love is not alone on
Clark Street.</p>

<p class='c013'>To be successful, an autographing cocktail party must
be planned with consummate skill and attention to detail.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>You must leave nothing to chance. You may not pretend
that everything will work out satisfactorily at the last minute.
It will not. And because I respected writers so much,
I tried to guard them against the ultimate humiliation of
sitting at a table before a pile of their own books, with no
buyers.</p>

<p class='c014'>I adopted the following procedure: First, get from the
author his own list of names—people he would like personally
to invite to his party. Phone each of them, or at
least write a post card asking if they are interested in receiving
a signed copy of the book. Next, send out the invitation
to all your charge accounts, then check the mailing
list for people you think will be interested in the book.
Avoid freeloaders. Invite the press and the literary critics
and try to write a short human interest story for the columnists.
In short, build up as big an advance as possible.</p>

<p class='c014'>Furthermore, don’t throw a skimpy party. People carry
away impressions, and the only <a id='corr41.20'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='inpression'>impression</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_41.20'>impression</a></span> you can afford
is a bountiful one. It is said that all the world loves a lover,
but one thing you can be sure of is that they love a winner.
So avoid failure by planning against it, and then pray.
Pray that it won’t rain or turn freezing cold, that the pipes
won’t break or the electricity be turned off. Pray that
you may fulfill your multiple responsibilities; to the author,
the publisher, and your own hopes for continuing
operation.</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed natural that one of our greatest cocktail parties
should be given for Nelson Algren upon publication
of <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i>. Yet behind the scenes
things went very oddly, and for a time it was hard to tell
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>whether either the author or the publisher wanted the
party—or the large downtown department store, either,
which entered the picture as a prospect for the event.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anyway, it took place at the Seven Stairs. Ken McCormick,
Editor-in-Chief of Doubleday, Nelson’s publisher,
flew into Chicago. I can see him still, loaded with books
in both arms, carrying them from one room to another.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was high excitement—newspaper photographers
and an unbelievable crush of people. It all began to tell
on Nelson’s nerves and mine. It seemed to me he was writing
too long in each book, and at times he would change
his mind in the middle of an inscription and ask for another
copy (to Nelson such revision was a literary exercise,
to me a spoiled copy was a financial loss). The line
of guests seemed endless and I began to develop an active
dislike for people, for money, for the whole business.
Besides, it was getting awfully hot. Nelson and Ken and
I removed our coats. Nelson even gave up writing long
paragraphs in each book. I tried keeping a cool drink at
his side at all times. It seemed to help.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a great but strange party. Nelson was a success,
and in a way I was, too. And this altered things enormously.
It had never occurred to me how people attach
themselves to the rescue phantasy, how easily failure inspires
love, how differently even the semblance of success
affects relationships. All at once, people who had only
wanted to help me became hypersensitive and found me
snubbing them. And I was feeling a new sensitivity also:
“You can’t destroy me in the process of buying from me.”
It was the beginning of a new struggle.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The last guest finally left. Ken McCormick was a very
happy publisher. I swept all interior confusions aside
and counted up the books. We had sold one thousand
copies of <i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i> in a single night!
It was almost too much for Ken—he had to see it to believe
it. And we were all dead tired. Just as I was about
to turn the last light switch before we went out the door,
I remembered and asked Nelson to autograph a book for
me. As he bent down to write, I could see Bob Kohrman
and myself sitting on the sand dunes reading the galleys of
the book. I remembered conversations with Nelson and
Jack Conroy in regard to the title, and Jack’s needling of
Nelson when the advances were running out, saying, “Any
day now you’ll be begging to come to work on the encyclopedia”
(the constant drudgery to which Jack has given
most of his working hours for two decades.)</p>

<p class='c014'>Nelson, crouching over the book, wrote: “For Stuart
and Jennie. The best in the West (as well as the South,
North and East). Because he’s the boy with the golden
wife—and she’s the girl with the golden guy.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For there was indeed now a Jennie, a golden girl with
whose short life mine was now linked in a more responsible
relationship than I had ever imagined I would assume—a
decisive part in the unimaginable future building before
me.</p>

<p class='c015'>We were all on our way now, but Jack Conroy was the
last to leave. He had waited until the very end to say,
“Papa, it was a fine party. I’m proud of you and your efforts
for Nelson.” They were all gone now, the columnists,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>the celebrities, the crowd that stretched in a file of twos
almost to the corner drug store. Only Jack Conroy, a huge
and gentle man with his “Hello, Papa,” the extended
hand, and the tiny stare in the blue, grey-flecked eyes,
always waiting, wondering how you are going to accept
his greeting.</p>

<p class='c014'>This is the wild, humorous, tender man who gave
Tennessee Williams his first important break, who first
published Richard Wright, who wrote a <a id='corr44.10'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='best-seller'>bestseller</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_44.10'>bestseller</a></span> thirty
years ago that is highly regarded by the few who remember
it, and who is rated as the second most popular American
author in all of Russia, one below Melville and one
above Poe.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c016'><sup>[1]</sup></a> His only material reward: a purported fortune
in rubles which he has no intention of ever collecting.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Jack edited <i>Midland Humor</i>, a discerning anthology
published in 1947, he was late to his own party at
the Seven Stairs. When he arrived, I was shaken, as I always
am, by his look of, “Will I be scolded? Will I be forgiven?”</p>

<p class='c014'>He can be the most jocular of men, and the most understanding.
One afternoon over coffee at the Seven Stairs
he reported at hilarious lengths on the drinking prowess of
his friend, Burl Ives, who was then doubling between a
cabaret engagement at the Blackstone Hotel and the vaudeville
show at the Chicago Theater. I was in the depth
of my psychiatric period and suggested that help might
be in order.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>“He doesn’t seem unhappy about it,” said Jack, innocently.</p>

<p class='c014'>Today Conroy, one of the most talented men in American
letters, quietly stands and looks. When he talks, he
stares directly at you, or turns his head entirely away
and speaks to empty space.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think he is the most honest man I have ever met: in
his intent, in his appraisal of others and their writing, and
in his own bereavement. As the gait grows slower, the shyness
becomes more pronounced and the gaze extends
away farther and farther.</p>

<p class='c014'>He has been called the Samuel Johnson of the Chicago
South Side. The designation fits in many ways—the
large physical build, the forceful expression and comprehensive
knowledge, the long toil in the compilation of
reference works—and in some ways not at all. He has
been many things, at times even a wandering player, and
his physiognomy suggests a somewhat more cerebral
William Bendix.</p>

<p class='c014'>He can provide the most wonderful encouragement to
others. But his own burden is lack of time—lack of time
for all his obligations, for all he should do. Publisher
after publisher offers him handsome advances, and he declines
them. He knows he would not fulfill the obligation.</p>

<p class='c014'>We were at lunch not long ago. “I’m going down to
Mexico on my vacation,” he said. “I’m going to visit Motley.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had known the tragic eyes of Willard Motley, whose
<i>Knock on Any Door</i> did not fill our friend, Algren, with
any particular enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“You know, that Nelson is mean,” Jack said. “He wrote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>some nasty things about me in the <i>Reporter</i>. Did you see
that?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, he did. We used to see a lot of each other.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We walked back to the office building where Jack does
his faithful, painstaking hack work.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll drop you a line from Mexico,” he said. “I’ll tell
Motley that you’re writing a book. Take care of yourself.
I’ll see you when I get back.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The grey-blue eyes were suddenly swollen with sadness,
and the voice stretched in a heavier drawl. I wished
with all my heart that things would work out well for Jack
Conroy.</p>

<p class='c015'>The relationship between genius and disaster is too
deep for me to comprehend. I do know that genius is
never made; it is only discovered. There has to be a front
runner. The notion that genius will out, regardless of circumstances,
is simply to ignore the nature of genius, which
must center upon itself in order to function. I sometimes
think that the energy expended in creating a really
imaginative work drains the humanity out of the artist.
If his personal life suffers as a consequence, his business
acumen is even more incidental.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The Man with the Golden Arm</i> was Algren’s great commercial
success, and the harvest was reaped by others.
The story is told, or at any rate that part which has any
bearing on this discourse, in a classic letter from Nelson to
Otto Preminger, producer of the movie which bore the
title, if not the imprint, of the novel:</p>

<p class='c019'>Dear Mr. Preminger:</p>

<p class='c019'>I am advised by your office that arrangements are now under
way to award me the sum of two hundred and three dollars
and seventy-eight cents, spent by myself to proceed, upon your
invitation, to the city of Los Angeles. I find this gesture most
generous, but am compelled to inform you that this money was
spent to no purpose to which you are member. Thank you all
the same.</p>

<p class='c019'>I am further instructed that arrangements are also under way
to compensate me, at the rate of thirty-five dollars per diem,
for listening to the expression of certain thoughts, after a
manner of speaking, by yourself. These occurred between
January 27th and 31st inclusively. But since these were all,
like the novel about which you wove them, the property of
other persons living or dead, I cannot in conscience honor
them by acceptance of such compensation. Again I am grateful.
And again I am instructed that a check for the sum of seven
hundred and fifty dollars, in addition to the above items, is due
me from yourself. I assume this may well be an effort to repay
me for some twelve pages of double-spaced typing I achieved
in an effort to discover what in God’s name you were talking
about. Since these pages served only to confuse you further,
no moneys are rightfully due me. Yet your thoughtfulness
does not cease to move me.</p>

<p class='c019'>Should this concern for me derive from a simple and heartfelt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>gratitude for a diversion afforded you for a full week by “an
interesting person,” as you so happily put it when the moment
came for parting, I do not feel you are so much indebted.
Although I did not find in you an interesting person, I did discover
one of arrogance approaching the uncanny. Upon the
basis of mutual amusement, therefore, I am the debtor. And
since you are decidedly more uncanny than I am interesting, I
must at a rough estimate, owe you close to forty dollars.</p>

<p class='c019'>And forward this sum confident of your satisfaction in alms
from any quarter, however small, and remain</p>

  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>5</span><br>The Day My Accountant Cried</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I dislike being interrupted when I am interesting someone
in a book. One late afternoon while I was engaged
in making a sale, my accountant tiptoed over and stood
close to me. I moved away, but he came close again. I
frowned; generally that was enough to frighten him. But
not this time.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I must speak with you,” he said. “It’s very important.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, what is it?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>His thin shoulders sagged and when he finally spoke,
his voice contributed to the general impression of a small,
furry animal in a trap. “You are bankrupt,” he squeaked.</p>

<p class='c014'>My accountant was a limp rag of a man with a lined,
ashen face and a bald head spotted with a few patches
of nondescript hair. The color of his eyes was an odd mixture,
neither grey nor brown, and he never met your
gaze, but looked down at your feet or to one side. He
wore a grey suit with a vest that had specially made
pockets to contain his pharmaceutical supplies, including
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>not only pill boxes and bottles, but his own spoon and a
collapsible cup.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although he was very neat, he bit his fingernails to the
quick. Still, I found his hands fascinating when he added
up columns of figures. His figure 8’s and his 7’s had a special
quality about them, a precision bordering upon
elegance.</p>

<p class='c014'>He came into the store once a month, went over my
bookkeeping, prepared the necessary forms for my signature,
and left. Sometimes he would linger for just a few
minutes looking at titles on the bookshelves. Then he
would turn, shrug his shoulders, and depart.</p>

<p class='c014'>When he looked up and informed me tragically, “You
are bankrupt,” the words were utterly meaningless to me.
“Wait until I finish,” I said, waving him aside, “then we’ll
talk.” His distress was pitiful, yet I couldn’t help laughing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Talk we did. He showed me the stack of unpaid statements,
then my bank balance, then the cost of my inventory.
There was no doubt about it: I was bankrupt. Those
pretty 8’s and magnetic 7’s proved it. The ledger sheets
with the long red and blue lines and the numbers so small
and so beautifully shaped within the spaces spoke the
awful truth. But somehow this truth meant nothing to
me, except strangely to remind me of a story told by my
father about a man who lost a leg but ran on as though he
still possessed two.</p>

<p class='c014'>I looked at my accountant in silence. He sat next to
me, his squeaky voice now still, his red-rimmed eyes peering
at me and at the evidence lying before us on the desk,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>along with a neat pile of Kleenex sheets, a spoon, and a
bottle of pink medicine. My accountant’s adam’s apple
began moving silently in his throat and as I observed this,
I placed my man as a literary character with whom I
was well familiar, the awful little man in <i>The Magic
Mountain</i> who mashed all his food together, bent his head
over it, and shoveled and pushed the mess into his mouth.
Again I began to laugh helplessly, and my accountant
kept saying, “Not funny, not funny, remember—you are
bankrupt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What do you suggest?” I finally asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is not much <i>to</i> suggest,” he said. “The books
show bankruptcy. File for bankruptcy and call it a day.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Just like that?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The figures are correct,” he said. “To me this means
you must go out of business.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“But what does it mean to me? I love this business and
want to remain in it. I’ve spent three years building it
and look at the progress I’ve made!”</p>

<p class='c014'>“It can’t be helped,” he said. “Business is business.
Your publishers are not sentimental. When they send you
books, they want to be paid.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course I intended to pay, I assured him. But I
couldn’t pay everyone all at once. And if I was serving
as an agent for their wares, couldn’t some of them wait?
Or couldn’t I go to the bank for another loan?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Impossible,” he said. “Furthermore, no one cares
about your good work or your bad work. Your problem is
that you haven’t the money to meet your bills.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Strangely enough—immorally perhaps—it had never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>occurred to me that this was my problem. Finally I said,
“As a favor to me, could you pretend that you hadn’t
come here this evening? Could you forget this conversation?
As I see it, nothing has changed whatsoever. So
far, the only person threatening me with bankruptcy is
yourself. It seems to me that if you will just stop talking
about it, I am no longer bankrupt.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My accountant poured himself a cupful of pink medicine,
smacked his lips, and burst into tears. He assured
me that I was partially responsible for his ulcerated stomach.
And he told me of his fate ... the three times he
had tried to pass the C.P.A. examinations ... the scorn
and derision to which he was subjected by fools like me
... the plight of his wife and his children ... and his
simple allegiance to the truth of numbers.</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to feel terribly guilty. What had I done to him
by not breaking beneath the impact of his shocking pronouncement?
“Please don’t cry,” I said. “Nothing is
really changed, actually. I just don’t believe in figures. I
don’t believe in bankruptcy. I still believe in people, in
myself, in my work. Sometimes I wake up in the morning
feeling joyous and sometimes I go to bed feeling wretched,
but that’s life. However, it is entirely my fault for making
you cry. I meant to take you seriously, but I have a complete
contempt for figures.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I brought him some water in his own antiseptic cup
and told him the story of the Little Prince and the Fox
and how the Fox made the Prince repeat: “Remember always—what
is essential is invisible to the eye. It is the
time you have wasted on your rose that makes her so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>important. Love means care and labor and respect. You are
responsible for what you love.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I observed a different accountant sitting before me. In
the course of my resistance to the destruction of my dream,
I had apparently turned upon him in a way that was completely
novel, neither scorning him nor using him, but
speaking to him as a member of the human race.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve never done this before,” he admitted, wiping his
eyes. “But your attitude in the face of certain failure just
broke me up. And here I am ... owning two houses, a
piece of a hotel, and some stocks and bonds ... more
money than you’ll probably ever see. Yet I realize how
very little I have ... on the other side of the ledger.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I was astounded that he was not angry, found a copy
of <i>The Little Prince</i> to give him, and as he left called,
“You’ve forgotten your spoon and the medicine.” He
hesitated a moment, but did not turn back.</p>

<p class='c014'>My accountant never again told me I was bankrupt.
Several months passed before I next saw him, but since
I continued to ignore the “figure” side of the business, his
absence did not disturb me. Then one bright and lovely
morning he came in wearing a fresh, newly pressed suit
and ... no vest!</p>

<p class='c014'>“How marvelous!” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No vest, ever again,” he assured me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What happened?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, you remember when I left? I still didn’t believe
you, but I read <i>The Little Prince</i> that evening. I used to
think that facts and the gathering of facts were the only
basis for living. But I realize now it is a much harder job.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>It is easier to be hypochondriac ... or a slave to the
logic of the marketplace ... or anything but one’s self.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Does experience teach? Is it possible that a human
being may be altered or set free through the written
word? Are books important? Is it important to be a bookseller?
Even though you are going broke? I had been
turning like a worm in an apple for so long that it seemed a
little more turning could scarcely hurt me.</p>

<p class='c015'>One night I was awakened by the insistent ringing of
the telephone.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you come down to the restaurant at once, son?”
It was Ric Riccardo’s voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>In less than an hour, I was seated in a booth with Ric,
the late Henry Beaudeaux, then art critic for the <i>Chicago
Daily News</i>, and Michael Seller, a psychoanalyst, with
whose professional world I had just begun an acquaintance
through interesting circumstances which I shall soon
describe.</p>

<p class='c014'>After I had sipped my coffee, Ric smiled thinly and
said, “Mike, tell him.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“How would you like to go into the publishing business?”
Mike said.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then Ric took over. Chicago needed a publishing
house, he argued. He was going to put up the money
and establish the organization. But we would publish
only Chicago talent regardless of their métier ... art,
poetry, novels, whatever. He continued for perhaps an
hour in this vein, dwelling upon the resources of talent
which existed in the Chicago area and the absurdity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>of depending on New York to “discover” it. Finally, I
wanted to know where I fitted in.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I supply the money,” Ric said. “You set up the office,
start the company going, get the writers. Tomorrow we’ll
meet with my lawyer.”</p>

<p class='c014'>He didn’t ask whether I liked the idea. He knew I was
crazy about it and would work day and night to see it
through.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you a name for the firm?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“We’ll call it the BrentR Press,” Ric said solemnly. And
with enthusiastic handclasps over this peculiarly ranch
house designation, we parted.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our first book was to be an art book titled, <i>Eleven Plus
Four</i>, principally to indicate the number of drawings to
be found in the book. The drawings by John Foote were
considerably more astounding than the title, and Sydney
J. Harris, columnist for the <i>Chicago Daily News</i>, wrote as
literate and perceptive an introduction as one is likely to
encounter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ric and I worked like a pair of furies on the project.
My association with the enterprise had a promotional
value that helped business at the store and I felt certain
that the way ahead lay open and that hard work was all
that was required.</p>

<p class='c014'>When Ric gave me a check for $5,000.00 and said, “Go
to a bank and open an account,” I headed straight out to
find the vice president of the bank where I had but a few
years earlier been turned down for a loan. He was gone,
but in his place I found a banker who was also a man.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>Following this successful encounter, I rushed back to
show Ric the receipted deposit slip. He laughed and took
me up to his studio. He pointed to an army footlocker and
said, “Open it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I did, and the sight of its contents overwhelmed me. It
was full of money—currency of every denomination.</p>

<p class='c014'>“When you need money, come upstairs and help yourself,”
he said. “Only tell me afterwards.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I wondered what my accountant would think. Even
after his reformation, this kind of profligacy must have
been beyond his comprehension.</p>

<p class='c015'>At first nobody talked about it. Ric had become ill and
he could not be seen. When there were urgent decisions
to make, I was told, “Make them yourself.” But I was not
sure of myself, I explained. The answer was the same.
Ric was not to be disturbed under any circumstances.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two months passed before I was permitted to go to the
hospital to see him. He lay curled up in bed like a child,
incredibly thin, the close-cropped hair completely grey,
the skin waxen. I sat beside him for a long time before he
unwound his body and looked at me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Go ahead and work, son,” he said. “You can do everything.
When I get better we’ll talk about the book. If you
need anything, go see Charley. I’ll call you when I can.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I left feeling certain that I would never see Ric alive.
I called Michael Seller and asked him to level with me. “It
was his heart,” Mike said. In his judgment, it was just a
question of time.</p>

<p class='c014'>I hung up feeling that my world was coming to an end.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>If Ric was wounded, I was, too. If his survival was in
doubt, I questioned my own. Every pattern I touched, no
matter how vital, seemed to resolve itself into my own lostness.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we were all wrong, doctors and friends alike. Ric
came back strong. To be sure, the bags about the eyes
were more pronounced, the skin hung a bit loosely about
the face and neck. But one had only to look into the eyes
to see that the fire was still there. Ric was all right, loving
life, loving people, giving joy to all who came into his
presence.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a new mark upon him, however, of increased
gentleness. He spoke gently, moved gently, dressed
gently, even ate gently. When we played chess, it was no
longer with the same intensity. He would even interrupt
the game to talk about the nature of God. He was becoming
non-attached.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally the book came off the press. It was a beautiful
job of production, and everyone whose name was known
in Chicago seemed to have come to the autographing
party in the spacious rooms above the restaurant. Ric sat
at a table surveying the scene, and couldn’t have cared
less. He was gracious to everyone. He nodded his approval
at all the checks I had received for advance orders. He
seemed pleased with my enthusiasm for success. But
something had gone out of him—at least so far as ardor
for parties and promotion was concerned.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ric died one week later, and with him many dreams,
the BrentR Press among them.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>6</span><br>The Man with the Golden Couch</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I am a great believer in the theory of “attractiveness.”
This theory is a way of describing a commonly experienced
relationship between external events and what
you feel in your heart. Something inside tells you that
you are “ready,” and then out of the world of events happenings
begin to occur which seem exclusively yours. The
conditions were there all the time, but your heart wasn’t
ready to accept them—hence the “attractiveness” in the
world did not reveal itself. But when your heart is ready,
whatever it is ready for will be fulfilled.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the first step in this fulfillment was my marriage
to Jennie, a girl with a strong, fine face and long
brow, a generous soul, and a brilliant talent. In spite of
the growing fame of the Seven Stairs, we faced a hard
struggle for existence. New people were coming to buy
books, mink coats mingling with hand-me-downs, but I
made only grudging concessions to what many of them
wished to buy. I refused to carry how-to-do-it books,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>occult books, books written and published by charlatans,
books pandering to junk-eaters. I wouldn’t even “special
order” junk.</p>

<p class='c014'>While I was limiting my practice to the least profitable
aspects of the book business, Jennie’s personal income as
a staff pianist at a television station was cut off completely
when the management eliminated most of the musicians
from the payroll. So she came to help at the Seven Stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Late one evening when I was alone in the store, an unlikely
customer came in, walking with a slightly swaying
motion and conveying a general attitude of, “You can’t
help me. I’m on an inspection tour. Stay away.” An effort
to engage him in conversation met with stiff resistance,
so I retreated unhappily behind my desk. Finally
my man came over to the desk with a small volume of
Rilke’s poetry and asked whether I carried charge accounts.
When he saw me hesitate, he dipped into his
pocket and paid in cash, stripping the single dollar bills
from a sizeable bank roll, a demonstration which added
further to my resentment of Ira Blitzsten.</p>

<p class='c014'>With the exception of Ben Kartman, no one played a
more decisive part in shaping the future of my business
than Ira. In spite of the initial impression he made on
me, and my obvious reaction, he continued to come into
the store, and we became friends. He was an amazing
reader with an excellent library of books and recordings,
and he had an uncle, he told me, who was a lover of opera
and might be persuaded to buy books and records from
me.</p>

<p class='c014'>One morning I received a phone call from the uncle,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>Dr. Lionel Blitzsten, who asked if I had a recording of
the Verdi Requiem with Pinza. It was a rich, full, commanding
voice, and I was glad to be able to reply that I
did. He suggested that I bring it over immediately.</p>

<p class='c014'>Fortunately, he lived not far from the shop, but in a
world of opulence such as I had never encountered. On
arrival, I was sent by the maid to wait upstairs in the
master bedroom. The room was fitted out like an 18th
century drawing room. One wall was entirely covered
with books. Later I discovered that because of illness, he
did most of his entertaining here. I waited nervously, and
noticing money lying on top of the dresser, retreated across
the thick Turkish rug to the threshold and stayed there.</p>

<p class='c014'>He came up the stairs quickly—a man in a hurry, I
thought. But I was unprepared for his appearance, a kind
of giant panda, very short and bald, with perhaps a few
grey hairs straying about the temples, and wearing awesomely
thick glasses (he had been going blind for years).
His breathing was difficult (his lungs had a way of constantly
filling up from his exertions) and I was later informed
that his heart, too, was giving out. Platoons of
doctors had struggled to keep him alive over the years.</p>

<p class='c014'>What was really arresting (and somewhat terrifying)
about this fat, puffing little man was the face. Above the
glasses, the skull seemed all forehead; beneath, the clean-shaven
skin was baby pink and the mouth shaped like a
rosebud and just as red. That was it, the mouth ... and
when he spoke, the voice was musical, no longer deep, but
rather high in pitch.</p>

<p class='c014'>Our initial transaction was completed in a moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The Doctor looked at the records, asked the price, made
his way to the dresser, gave me two ten dollar bills,
thanked me, and vanished as quickly as he had appeared.
I walked down the stairs and left quietly, but my heart
was pounding.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was several weeks before Dr. Blitzsten called again,
very late in the evening. I recognized the sing-song quality
characteristic of his speech as he asked for several
books. I had all of them except the one he particularly
wanted ... he said he needed it to refresh himself with
a certain passage.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, never mind,” he said, “I’ll get the book elsewhere
tomorrow. Would you mind awfully delivering the others
tonight?”</p>

<p class='c014'>Again the maid let me in and sent me to the bedroom.
I waited in the doorway until the Doctor motioned me in
and asked me to deposit the books on a small table beside
the bed. He was sitting up in bed supported by a backrest,
a blinking Buddha in white, blue-trimmed pajamas
and covered with a thin, fine blanket. As I started to introduce
myself, he waved his hand and began to talk.</p>

<p class='c014'>So far as I knew, I had never before met a psychoanalyst,
and I had the feeling that my every word and move
would be subject to his scrutiny and probably found
wanting. As I answered his questions carefully, politely,
haltingly, I became increasingly jumpy and nervous. My
words wouldn’t come together as they usually did. I
found myself making the most ridiculous errors, catching
myself up only to discover that I was blushing. I was in
the wrong place and I wanted to go home.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>Somehow he was able eventually to put me at ease and
I merely sat and listened. Even when he voiced opinions
on Shakespeare which I felt certain were dead wrong, I
said nothing. What was important was the stream of his
language which was rapid, endless, scintillating, inexhaustibly
alive. His charm and wit, his knowledge of literature,
and his Voltairian cynicism thrilled me, while his
pin-point knowledge of Hebrew and Yiddish left me helpless.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally I was dismissed. He thanked me again for having
gone out of my way to deliver the books and told me
to “special order” the particular volume he needed (a
technical work of which I had never heard). He had decided
to wait for it.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following morning, I opened an account for Dr.
Blitzsten, and I called Ira to thank him for this introduction
to his remarkable uncle. I felt that something rather
peculiar was happening, but I had no idea that it was to
open up an entirely new phase in my business and in my
personal experience.</p>

<p class='c014'>The departure which was to make the difference between
my financial success or failure in the book business
was inaugurated upon my third visit to Dr. Blitzsten’s
residence. This time I was received in the downstairs
study, where the Doctor sat behind a tremendous, brilliantly
polished desk. He offered me a drink, which I
declined, for I was still very shy in his presence. Then he
launched quickly into the plan he had formulated.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I understand,” he said, “that you have recently married.
I understand that you have a struggling business. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>should like to offer a suggestion. Psychoanalysts have to
get most of their books directly from the publishers or from
dealers in England. Why don’t you put in a good stock of
such books? There will be immediate demand when I
tell my colleagues of it. And I will do one more thing, also.
I’ll help you buy the right titles.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Take these five books and compile the bibliographies
from them. Then come and see me Sunday afternoon and
I’ll help you make your selection.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I accepted a drink now, amazed by this sudden, generous
offer and the possibilities it opened to me. All I
could do was to sit and look, with a heart too flooded with
emotion for speech. I found words, finally, which must
have been the proper words, for he smiled gently as he
saw me to the door.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sunday afternoon, then. Goodnight,” he called.</p>

<p class='c014'>On Sunday morning the phone rang. It was Dr. Blitzsten
telling me that I should bring Jennie too. On arrival,
we were escorted into the living room. Again I felt in the
presence of a world of unbelievable grace and charm.
The long, elegantly proportioned room had a vaulted
ceiling and walls covered with early Chinese paintings.
At the far corner stood two ebony Steinways, back to
back. Dr. Blitzsten was seated near one of the pianos, sipping
a glass of wine. Ira was also there, along with Dr.
Harvey Lewis, who soon would become a Seven Stairs
“regular.” After the introductions, Dr. Blitzsten asked
Jennie to play for us.</p>

<p class='c014'>I felt terribly responsible. She had scarcely touched a
piano for months and I knew her extreme sensitivity as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>performing artist. But she went to the piano without a
word of apology and began playing Scarlatti, then an impassioned
Shostakovich prelude, and finally “The Girl
with the Flaxen Hair.” There was no doubt that she was
accepted, and I along with her.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went home with my book lists and the following morning
was busy writing letters, opening accounts, and beginning
the formation of one of the finest libraries of psychiatric
books ever gathered in a single bookstore.</p>

<p class='c014'>With Lionel Blitzsten’s help, I prepared the first psychiatric
book catalogue to come out of Chicago and
mailed it to every psychiatrist in the United States, to
every university library and institute for psychoanalysis,
and to selected prospects in Canada, Brazil, Germany,
even Africa. Because of Dr. Blitzsten’s extraordinary editing,
the catalogue featured books not readily obtained in
America. I became an active importer of English titles,
especially from the Hogarth Press, which had an outstanding
listing of psychoanalytic books.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few months later, I added a supplement to the
original catalogue, including books on psychology, philosophy,
anthropology, art and literature. I had quickly
discovered that psychoanalysts were deeply interested in
the impact of all areas of thought upon man’s inner experience
and his spiritual life. Soon ninety percent of my
business was coming from my new specialty, which continued
to thrive in spite of growing competition from New
York involving price-cutting which the publishers appeared
powerless to prevent. The local psychoanalysts
were my best accounts, and many of them, including Bob
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>Kohrman, Harvey Lewis, Fred Robbins, Richard Renneker,
Aaron Hilkevitch, Jack Sparer, Joel Handler, Stan
Gamm, Ernest Rappaport and Robert Gronner, along with
Katie Dobson, the obstetrician, and Harold Laufman, the
surgeon, became torch bearers for the Seven Stairs and
lasting friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even less expected than this boom in my business was
the social consequence of my deepening relationship with
Lionel Blitzsten. The last thing I would ever have conceived,
the last for which I would have hoped, as a consequence
of my career as a personal bookseller, was an induction
into the Proustian world of the coterie.</p>

<p class='c014'>The machinery of a coterie is simple; the reasons behind
its operation and its subtle influence on the lives of those
drawn into its orbit are complex almost beyond endurance.
Essentially, the coterie consists of a number of people
who hold <a id='corr65.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='similiar'>similar</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_65.19'>similar</a></span> views on unimportant things. Everyone
admitted must observe a cardinal prohibition: to say
nothing fundamental about anything. All must follow
the leader, employ a common stock of expressions, adopt
the same mannerisms, profess the same prejudices, affect
the same bearing, and recognize a common bond of impenetrable
superficiality.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was all to be seen from the first, although I would
not permit my heart to acknowledge it. We were there
for the entertainment of a sick, lonely, gifted man. Sitting
up in his huge bed, Lionel held forth on every subject
imaginable that related to human creativity. He talked
brilliantly, fluidly, endlessly, while his auditors listened,
sipped tea or coffee or a liqueur, bit into a cracker or sandwich,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>laughed or smiled when signaled to do so, or scowled
when necessary.</p>

<p class='c014'>The strange thing was that so many were envious and
wanted desperately to belong. But the number had to be
limited. Lionel did the choosing and he did the eliminating
(eventually, in fact, he discarded all but one!) He
used people as a machine uses oil. When a person ceased
to give what he needed or showed signs of drying up, the
search began for his replacement. For Lionel required
constant stimulation to avoid falling into melancholy. The
dinner parties and soirees to which he was addicted were
at once indispensable and boring to him, tonic and yet
destructive. The web of his character and his professional
and social commitments was so complex that it became
virtually impossible for him to find a situation of free and
natural rapport or one with which he could deal in any
way except capriciously. Hence his total need for the
“faithful.” Hence, too, if one of the “faithful” <a id='corr66.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='become'>became</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_66.19'>became</a></span> valueless,
out he went. Then began the cries and recriminations
and the storm of hysteria reigned supreme in the tea
cup.</p>

<p class='c014'>One could not remain a passive spectator in this little
world. If you can imagine a great hall with many rooms
occupied by solitary persons somehow bound to one another
by invisible, inextricable longings, with myself dashing,
hopping, skipping, running from one room to another,
you may have a sense of the nightmare my life was
becoming—a fantasy in which some incomprehensible
crisis was always arising or in which my business or personal
life might be interrupted at any hour of the day or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>night by a call from Lionel and the despotism of his utter
and absolute need.</p>

<p class='c014'>In my heart, I knew that my dream of being the Shelley
of the book business was rapidly disappearing. The act
of dressing for an evening of looking at the same well-cared-for,
well-groomed, vacuous people, eating the same
tired hors d’oeuvres, hearing the same gossip, filled me
with almost uncontrollable rage. Yet I was still caught up
in the excitement of being part of this new-found pretentious
world of middle-class wealth.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first time I was really shaken was at the Christmas
party. Along with others, I had helped trim the gigantic
tree while Lionel sat and amused us with tales and gossip.
The decorating job was truly a work of art and we
were all quite pleased with ourselves when we left, the
members of the inner circle lingering for a few minutes
after the others were gone before offering their thanks and
goodnights. We were saying our goodbyes, when Lionel
turned suddenly and looked at the pillows on his huge
couch.</p>

<p class='c014'>“They haven’t been fluffed up!” he said, in a voice of
command.</p>

<p class='c014'>Immediately several young analysts left their wives in
the hall, dropped their coats, and rushed back to “fluff.”</p>

<p class='c014'>The whole action was so unexpected and infantile that
the blood rushed to my head and for a moment I was dizzy
and unable to focus. And I had let myself in for this sort
of thing! Jennie and I left without saying goodnight.</p>

<p class='c014'>“There is a time when one goes toward Lionel and another
time when one goes away from him,” an analyst who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>had once been part of the inner circle remarked. This
indeed seemed to be the case, but my inner <a id='corr68.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='conflct'>conflict</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_68.2'>conflict</a></span> remained
unresolved. I was ashamed of living in a midnight
of fear. At the same time I felt privileged to know this
gifted and, so often, generous man, who understood the
human soul as few others have. I respected and loved
him and wanted to befriend him in every way that was
not a violation of my own being.</p>

<p class='c014'>As a group, I found analysts the most sensitive and intelligent
to be found in the professions. But there were
those I could not tolerate, no matter how much they spent
at the shop; the shock artists who fed off the agony and
terror of the bewildered, and the culturally illiterate who
viewed anything dealing with the creative as their province.
The atmosphere would begin to sizzle at the Seven
Stairs the moment any of the latter started analyzing
Mann, Gide, Dostoevsky, Ibsen, Kafka, Homer, anybody
and everybody. I had read Freud’s essay on Leonardo
Da Vinci and Ernest Jones’ on Hamlet with great
interest and decided that the whole approach was one
of intellectual gibberish, regardless of the serious intent
of these great men. But the young and unread analysts
were not even serious. When you cross-examined them,
you found they had never read the plays or books in question:
they were merely quoting an authority and taking
his word for it. Of course, it is a nasty thing to expose
anyone and it is sacrilegious to do it to an analyst. The
change in my relations with some of the psychoanalysts
became increasingly less subtle.</p>

<p class='c014'>To offset some of the business losses attendant on this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>turn of affairs, I hit on the idea of giving a series of lectures
in the store after closing hours. I offered a course
of five lectures on great men of literature at a subscription
price of ten dollars and was surprised to find I was talking
to standing room only. After a month’s respite, I tried
it again with similar success. Emmet Dedmon, then literary
editor of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i> heard one of the sessions
and was responsible for recommending me as a replacement
for the eminent Rabbi Solomon Goldman,
when he was taken sick before a lecture engagement. The
success of that one lecture was such that I was booked for
thirteen more. It seemed as though all was not lost.</p>

<p class='c014'>“It’s a big world,” I assured myself, sitting alone in the
shop before the fire. “The sun does not rise and set with
a handful of analysts.” It was a cool October night. Business
that day had been particularly good. My debts were
not pressing. I took heart.</p>

<p class='c014'>In apparent response to this cheerful frame of mind,
a smartly dressed customer entered the shop, a man of
medium build with blond hair parted in the middle and
a pair of the bluest eyes I had ever seen.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am looking for an out-of-print recording, the Variations
on a Nursery Theme by Dohnanyi,” he said. “Perhaps
you may have it?” The accent was unmistakably
British.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was obviously my day—I did have it! “I have something
else, also out-of-print, that might interest you,” I
said. “It’s the Dohnanyi Trio, played by Heifetz, Primrose,
and Feurmann.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, that,” he said. “I know that one. I played it.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>I hesitated, sensing some kind of ambiguity.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m Primrose,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>We chatted while I wrapped the records. He was
charmed by the shop—it had a really English flavor, he
said. Before I knew it, I was telling him the whole story
of the Seven Stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Until what time do you stay open?” he asked. “It’s
quite late.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m closing right now,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“If you have time, let’s have a drink,” he suggested. “I
should like to hear more.”</p>

<p class='c014'>On a sudden inspiration, I asked first to make a phone
call. While my customer browsed among the books, I
spoke with Lionel and asked if he would like me to bring
William Primrose over. He was ecstatic. At first note, his
voice had sounded forlorn, so empty of life that I guessed
him to be terribly sick. But mention of Primrose acted like
a shot in the arm.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Hurry!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told Mr. Primrose that my friend had a wonderful
bar and a devotion to great music. But he had already
heard of Dr. Blitzsten. “Isn’t that the analyst?” he said.
“My friends in the Budapest Quartet often used his home
for rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='c014'>So off we went. Lionel was at his best—charming, informative,
genuinely interested in the small talk carried
on by Mr. Primrose. I was delighted really to have pleased
him. When I left Primrose at his hotel that night, the
world seemed good again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet on the way home, I began to have hot and cold
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>flashes. Why had I called Lionel and offered to bring
Primrose? Why?</p>

<p class='c015'>A pleasant period followed, warmed by ripening friendships.
Jennie and I attended the Primrose concert and
dined with the great violist afterward. In years to come,
I was to see him frequently and even present him in a
memorable concert in my own shop.</p>

<p class='c014'>While at Orchestra Hall to hear Primrose, we had also
encountered Dr. Harold Laufman and his wife, Marilyn,
and through some instant rapport agreed to see each other
very soon. The result was an enduring friendship, as well
as one of the most pleasant parties ever held at the Seven
Stairs, a showing of Hal’s pictures which he had painted
in North Africa during the war. They were brilliant,
highly individualistic works.... “My impressions of disease,”
he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>The party was a delight, particularly because there
was no question of selling anything—the artist could
not possibly have been persuaded to part with any of his
pictures. There was nothing to do but pass out the drinks
and enjoy the company, which included a lovely woman
with reddish gold hair out of a Titian portrait who wanted
every book and record in the shop—and who was later
to deliver our first son. She was Dr. Catherine Dobson, an
obstetrician, an analysand of Dr. Blitzsten, and a great
and good friend.</p>

<p class='c015'>The day after our son was born, I received a call from
Lionel. “What are you going to name the baby?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>“We’ve decided on David,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“David?” he said. “That’s too plain. Why not call him
Travis? I just love the name Travis.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I admitted that Travis was fine, but perhaps a bit fancy.
“After all,” I said, “Jennie wants to call the boy David.
What’s the difference?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“A great deal of difference ... for the boy’s future,”
he said. “I love Travis. Suggest it to Jennie.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had to admit to Jennie that I was afraid to take a
stand. But was it too much ... to give just a little and
to keep things working for us?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Why are you letting this man ruin our lives?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I couldn’t answer she relented. David was
named Travis David.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the days following, I was afflicted with a recurrent
rash and sometimes by mysterious feelings of terror. I
had gone wrong somewhere, and a secret decision had
to be made. I picked up the phone, dialed a number, and
made an appointment.</p>

<p class='c014'>I started my analysis because I was in trouble. I
needed expert help and I went out and got it. Later it
dawned upon me that this is really the significant thing:
not that there are so many people in today’s world who
need help, but the miraculous urge on the part of the individual
himself to get well. The fact that people on the
whole don’t want to be sick, don’t want to be haunted by
nameless difficulties, convinces me that at the very bottom
of one’s being is the urge to be good, to the good.
This is more important than any description of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>experience of analysis, which, although it may be invaluable
to the person who suffers through it, is but a process of
living ... nothing more. After all, it was Freud who
said that life is two things: Work and Love.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I came to tentative grips with my fears of rejection—and
the self-rejections these fears imposed—I began
more and more to act like myself, like the man who started
the Seven Stairs. If Hamlet’s problem lay in his fear of
confusing reality and appearance, so, too, was mine. Only
I was not Hamlet and my task was not the avenging of a
father’s murder. My task was even more basic. I had to
just keep on giving birth to myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a long time before I perceived that Lionel Blitzsten
was less a cause of my problem than a factor in its
treatment. Who was this strange and often solitary genius,
who died leaving such a rich legacy of interpretative
techniques to his profession, who lived like an ancient
potentate, offering to a crowd of sycophants whatever
satisfactions are to be gained from basking in reflected
glory?</p>

<p class='c014'>My relationship with him revealed things which I was
slow in admitting to my analyst. I shall never forget the
energy I expended telling my analyst how “good” I was.
Fortunately I wasn’t in the hands of a charlatan. He interrupted
me—one of those rare interruptions—and
told me that we both knew how good I was, so quit wasting
time and money on <i>that</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Lionel was like life itself: an amalgam of selfishness,
egoism, cruelty; of goodness, gentleness, compassion. He
offered it all in almost cosmic profusion, and with cosmic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>capriciousness. Once he remarked: “The world owes me
nothing. When I die, I will not be sorry. I had joy, still
do; I had love, still have it; I had friends, still have them.
I had all and felt all and saw all and ... believed all.
I had everything and I had nothing. I had what I think
life, in its total meaning, is: I had the dream, the ‘chulum
mensch.’”</p>

<p class='c014'>This I believe is what he was—a “chulum mensch.”
It contained everything a dream could and should, good
and bad. And much of it was glorious. No one who shared
this part could thank him enough for the privilege of being
admitted.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>7</span><br>Farewell to the Seven Stairs</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I had to break it to them gently ... and to myself, as
well. It took a long time to compose the letter to go to all
my clients. “Sometime between June 30th and July 20th,”
the letter said, “the Seven Stairs will end its stand on Rush
Street and move to 670 North Michigan Avenue, where it
will resume life as Stuart Brent: Books and Records.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Everything that the Seven Stairs has come to stand
for will continue. The place will be lovely and cozy and
warm—the conversations easily as crazy and possibly
more inspired. More than that—all of the wonderful
possibilities that we have been developing over the past
five years can now bear fruit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I reviewed the history of the shop, trying to set down
some of the memorable landmarks in its growth. “...
and so it has gone,” I wrote blithely, “always fresh and
magical, punctuated by famous and admired visitors—Joseph
Szigeti, Katharine Cornell, Elliot Paul, Ernest
Hemingway, Arthur Koestler, Frieda Fromm Reichmann,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>Nelson Algren, Gore Vidal, Carol Brice, many others—wonderful
talk—parties—exhibits. You have been a
part of it with us.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But physically, the Seven Stairs could never meet our
needs fully. It was too small. Congestion forced us to
give up those author cocktail parties for launching good
new books. It kept us from promoting lectures and exhibits.
It put a definite limit to the size of our stock. And
even if we could have made more space, we couldn’t have
afforded it without an increase in street trade which Rush
Street couldn’t provide.</p>

<p class='c014'>“However, for all the crowding, the worn appearance,
the careless bookkeeping, the hopeless methods of keeping
our stock of books and records in proper order—the
Seven Stairs set the tone we dreamed of.</p>

<p class='c014'>“That tone—with all the ease and informality—will
go with it to Michigan Avenue. Probably nothing like it
has ever happened to the Avenue. It’s about time it did.”</p>

<p class='c014'>My message to the faithful was heartfelt, but more than
a little disingenuous. It mentioned the economics of bookselling
only in passing. And these economic factors had
at last caught up with me. I might ignore my accountant,
but when Jennie and I were invited among the well-fed
and well-cared-for, we were distinctly surrounded by the
aura of the “poor relation.” I might congratulate myself
upon having accomplished, against absurd odds, so much
of what I had initially dreamed about, but I was no longer
responsible only to this dream: I had a growing family—and
I wasn’t unhappy about this, either. It seemed to
me, in spite of all the evidence the modern world has to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>present to the contrary, that the fullness of life (in which
the feeding, clothing, and housing of a family traditionally
figure) ought not, as a matter of principle, stand irrevocably
opposed to personal fulfillment or spiritual realization.</p>

<p class='c014'>There wasn’t room in the Seven Stairs, it is true—for
books and records, for parties, for anything else. But
room is not the great necessity—it can always be made,
if the spirit is willing. The plain fact of the matter was
that my situation was economically self-limiting in its
scope and its momentum. Only a certain number of people
could be drawn into its sphere, and time and the accidents
of time would take their toll. Some of the parties
did not draw. Some of the clientele who dropped out or
who were alienated through the vagaries of my personal
relations were not replaced. I was either going to have to
regress toward my beginnings or advance toward something
which would suggest, at least, the possibility of
greater scope.</p>

<p class='c014'>Did this possibility exist along a well-traveled market
place (the Chicago version of Fifth Avenue, although
pictorially more impressive than its Manhattan counterpart),
which lay only a block away from the questionable
Rush Street area?</p>

<p class='c014'>The opportunity to confront this question came about,
again, through one of the apparent accidents of life, which
I identify under the rather occult heading of “attractiveness.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Without Jack Pritzker there could have been no move
to Michigan Avenue. Jack and his wife, Rhoda, came into
our lives at a cocktail party and became close friends.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Rhoda is English by birth and wears her charm and dignity
like a delicate mystery. She has a gift for seeing and
has written wonderful articles as a correspondent for British
newspapers. Jack, also, has the effortless manner that
stems from a quality of mind. He is as unlike me as any
man can be: impassive, almost secretive, yet I have never
known a more comfortable man to be with. He is a lawyer
with large interests in real estate and a quiet passion for
being a mover behind the success of others. He will not
forsake you when the going is rough, but in his relations
he holds to a fine line between friendship and duty—and
holds you to this line also. I had already experienced the
danger of the kind of benefactor who tends to take over
your life for you but with Jack Pritzker there is never this
danger. He prefers to see you make it on your own. If
you are beset by circumstances which you cannot control,
he is there; but if you are merely waiting for something
to happen, you can expect nothing but the criticism you
deserve.</p>

<p class='c014'>This gentle, quiet man, tough yet sentimental, absorbed
in his business, yet somehow viewing it as an experiment
with life rather than a livelihood, devoted to
concrete matters and the hard world of finance and power,
yet in conversation concerned only with the breadth of
life and the humanness of experience, provided a scarcely
felt polarity that gave direction to my often chaotic forces.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I heard that Jack had a financial interest in a
medical office building under construction on Michigan
Avenue, I asked to rent one of the street level stores. It
was not a matter of seeking financial assistance—it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>entirely enough to be accepted as the kind of “prestige
tenant” normally sought for such a location. But when
Hy Abrams, my lawyer, went to see about the lease, he
reported that Jack remarked, “If you think I’m letting
Stuart in this store to see him fail, you are mistaken. I
have no intention of standing by and watching him and
his family tenting out in Grant Park.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But even though someone might be keeping a weather
eye on my survival, I had to face up to my own money
problems. It is madness to go into business without a
bankroll under the mattress. I thought I could see my way
to making it on the Avenue, but where was the cash outlay
coming from for fixtures, additional stock, everything?
Not even my reformed accountant could prepare a financial
statement that would qualify me for additional bank
loans.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a way, however, and it was opened to me by
a client who, as a vice president of the First National Bank
of Chicago, was about the last person I thought of approaching
with my difficulties. I knew about banks by
now, although I had somewhat revised my opinions about
the personal limitations of all bankers. In fact, it was always
a source of genuine pleasure to me when this particular
banker, a tall, handsome man with greying hair
and a fine pair of grey eyes to match, came into the shop.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I told him of my projected move, it was natural
for him to ask how I was financing it. I told him I didn’t
know, but I was certainly going to have to find a way.</p>

<p class='c014'>“May I offer a suggestion?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat down by the fire, and he told me first what I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>already knew: that normally when a business man needs
extra money, especially for a cyclical business dependent
on certain seasons, he will go to the bank for a short-term
loan, say for ninety days. But in New York, he told me,
there is a large department store that finances its own
improvement and expansion programs. Instead of going
to the bank, the store goes to its customers. My friend
suggested that I do the same.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Here’s how it works,” he said. “Write a letter to your
hundred best accounts explaining what you hope to do.
Ask them to help by sending you one hundred dollars in
advance payment against future purchases. In return,
you will offer them a twenty percent discount on all merchandise
purchased under this plan. And of course they
may take as long a time as they wish in using up the
amount they have advanced.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Even as he spoke, he pulled out his pen and began
composing the letter. We worked on it for an hour, and
the next day we met at lunch to draft the final copy. I
sent the approved message to one hundred and twenty-five
people, and I received one hundred and twenty-five
replies—each with a hundred dollar check!</p>

<p class='c014'>There remained little else to do in the way of arrangements
except to break my present lease. It was not easy,
but it was a pleasure. Now that I planned to move, my
landlord’s attitude was something to behold. He danced
the length of the shop on his tiny feet, his cane twirling
madly, alternating between cries of “Excellent! Your future
is assured!” and “But of course you’ll pay the rent
here, too!” He did not know, he said, what “the corporation”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>would think of any proposal for subletting the premises.
Finally he doffed his black hat, waved goodbye,
and skipped out of the store.</p>

<p class='c014'>A week later I heard from him. The answer on subleasing
was a qualified yes. If I could get a tenant as responsible
and dignified as myself and with equally brilliant
prospects for success, they would consider it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I advertised for weeks and no such madman responded.
Then one day the answer walked in the door, a huge man
with the general physique of the late Sidney Greenstreet,
hooded eyes, and a great beard. He looked around,
blinked like an owl, and said he’d take it. It was as simple
as that. I realized, with a slight sinking feeling, that I
was now perfectly free to move to the Avenue.</p>

<p class='c014'>My formidable successor to the home of the Seven Stairs
turned out to indeed be a man of brilliant prospects. He
opened a Thought Factory, evidenced by a sign to this
effect and bulletin boards covered with slips of paper bearing
thoughts. Needless to say, he was in the public relations
and advertising business. I have always felt grateful
to him, but I never got up courage to cross that once
adored threshold and see Mr. Sperry making thoughts.</p>

<p class='c015'>When the Columbia Record people approached me
concerning the possibility of a party in connection with
the release of a record by the jazz pianist, Max Miller, it
struck me this might be just the thing as a rousing, and
possibly rowdy, farewell to the Seven Stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Somehow, when I phoned our original fellows in literature,
the gaiety of my announcement did not come off. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>called Bob Parrish, who had once turned an autographing
party into a magic show, and was greeted by an awesome
silence, followed by a lame, “We’ll be there.” There was
similar response from others on the list, but they <i>did</i> come,
all of them ... even Samuel Putnam, who journeyed
all the way from Connecticut.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had rented a piano and managed to get it in
through the back of the building by breaking through a
wall. The bricks were terribly loose anyway, and it wasn’t
much work to put them back and replaster when it was
all over. Max Miller had promised to bring along a good
side man, and he did: Louis Armstrong. Armstrong was
immediately comfortable in the shop. “This is a wise man,”
he said. He didn’t know I was giving up the ghost at the
Seven Stairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the end of the Stairs was a symbol for more
than the demise of a personal book store. During
the period in which I had set up shop, the old <i>Chicago
Sun</i> had launched the first literary Sunday supplement
devoted entirely to books to be published by a newspaper
outside of New York City. At least one issue of this supplement,
called “Book Week,” had carried more book advertising
than either the <i>New York Times</i> “Book Review”
or the <i>Herald Tribune</i> “Magazine of Books.” The <i>Chicago
Tribune</i> had followed suit with a book supplement and,
together with the <i>Sun</i>, offered a platform for people like
Butcher, Babcock, North, Apple, Frederick, Kogan,
Wendt, Spectorsky, and others who were not only distinguished
critics and authors, but who truly loved the
world of books. Their efforts had certainly contributed
to the climate that made the Seven Stairs possible. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>diminution of this influence (today only the <i>Tribune</i> carries
a full-scale book supplement) was in direct relationship
to the decline of my own enterprise.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the last party, everyone came. There were the remaining
literary editors, Fanny Butcher of the <i>Tribune</i>,
Emmet Dedmon of the <i>Sun-Times</i>, and Van Allen Bradley
of the <i>Daily News</i> (the latter two fated to move along to
editorial positions on their newspapers). There was Otto
Eisenschiml and there was Olive Carrithers, for whom
one of our first literary parties had been given. The psychoanalysts
came: Lionel Blitzsten (who had assured
everyone that I really wouldn’t, couldn’t, make the move),
Roy Grinker, Fred Robbins, Harvey Lewis, and of course
Robert Kohrman, who was still to see me through so much.
There was Sidney Morris, the architect; Henry Dry, the
entrepreneur; Ed Weiss, the advertising executive who
discovered the subliminal world and asked which twin
had the Toni; and Everett Kovler and Oscar Getz of the
liquor industry. Louis played and sang and signed records
and shook hands and sang some more, and Miller
played and autographed while the apparent hilarity grew,
the shouting, laughing, and singing. It was a very little
shop, and had there been rafters you could have said it
was full to them. But Ben Kartman was grim,
Reuel Denny seemed bewildered, and above all, the old
gang: Algren, Conroy, Parrish, Terkel, Motley, Herman
Kogan ... they were being charming and decent
enough, but something was out of kilter. I had never seen
them more affable, but it wasn’t quite right—being affable
wasn’t really their line.</p>

<p class='c014'>Terkel occasionally emerged from the throng to m.c. the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>performance. Studs Terkel is a Chicago phenomenon, a
talented actor and impresario of the wellsprings of culture,
whether jazz or folksongs. In the early days of commercial
television, when the experimenting was being
done in Chicago, he created a type of entertainment perfectly
adapted to the intimate nature of the medium.
“Studs’ Place” was the hottest show in Chicago, so far as
the response of viewers went, but it soon disappeared. Apparently
what Chicago offered could not be exported. The
strange belief continues to persist that the tastes of
America can properly be tested only on the Broadway
crowd (the knowing) or the Hollywood Boulevard
misfits (the paranoiac). The crowds and misfits elsewhere
do not seem to constitute a suitable national index.
Anyway, so far we have not been able to export Studs.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the growing crowd and increasing turbulence and
raucousness, I didn’t care any longer what happened. I
just stood in a corner and tried to look friendly. Rhoda
and Jack Pritzker came in with a party of friends. People
were crushing about Studs and Louis, urging Louis to
sing and Max to play. Suddenly I was terribly tired. I
wanted air. I was just getting out when the ceiling came
down.</p>

<p class='c014'>The toilet was on the second floor (it served the entire
building) and, never very dependable, it had come to the
end of the line. When it broke, the water came flooding
down through the ceiling onto the people in the shop and
taking the plaster with it. Louis was soaked. I shall always
remember Rhoda Pritzker barraged by falling plaster
and Dorothea Parrish losing her poise and letting out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>a war whoop. Studs got a piece of ceiling in his eye. Max
Miller was directly beneath the broken pipe and suffered
the consequences. For some moments it seemed as though
the total disintegration of the aged structure was at hand.</p>

<p class='c014'>I ran up the stairs and began applying my best flood
control technique. Finally, with the aid of a pile of rags,
we managed to staunch the flow. Those engaged were
exhausted, but the party was made; now the laughter
rang with real gaiety and the songs soared with enthusiasm.
It was one hell of a wake.</p>

<p class='c014'>The last song was “Honeysuckle Rose.” The damp
musicians thanked everyone for listening and said
goodbye. There was a hurry of leavetaking. Soon only
Ira Blitzsten, Bob Kohrman, and Ben Kartman remained.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was nothing left but to turn off the lights and
close up, yet I couldn’t bring myself to rise from behind
the desk. No more building inspectors, no more landlord
wishing me good luck, no more broken plumbing ...
just the end of the world. All I had to do was get up, look
around for the last time, turn off the lights.</p>

<p class='c014'>Look around at what? The old bookshelves made out
of third grade lumber? The dark green walls that Tweedy
and Carl Dry had helped paint? The absurd little bench
with its hopeful inscriptions? I didn’t need to worry about
the bench. I could take that with me.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was the barrel in the corner, half full of apples
... the battered old coffee pot sitting on the hot plate
... and the string dangling from the ceiling from which
a salami once depended. I always bought my sausage
from a little old Hassidic Jew who appeared from time to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>time in his long black coat, black hat, and with a grey
and black beard extending down his chest. We would
haggle over the price and he would shower me with blessings
when he left. All of this was spiced with Rabelaisian
jests. Once I asked him, while studying the sausage situation,
“Tell me, do you think sex is here to stay?” He
thought a moment. “I don’t know vy not,” he said. “It’s
in a vunderful location!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Somehow, I did not see a salami hanging in my new
Michigan Avenue location.</p>

<p class='c014'>But onward and upward! Don’t turn back now, or
Lionel’s prediction will come true. All is well. The lease
is signed, the fixtures are paid for, you’ve o.k.’d the color
the walls are to be painted, no one is threatening you,
and you’ve put down a month’s advance on the rent. So
please get up and turn off the lights.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was not I, but a zombie moving mechanically toward
the future, who touched the button, left the room, and
softly shut the door.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>8</span><br>On the Avenue</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>In all my life, I had never shopped on Michigan Avenue.
I had no idea who was in business there or what they
sold (except for a general feeling that they sold expensive
merchandise and made plenty of money). It was only
after I had opened the doors of Stuart Brent: Books and
Records, that I discovered what a strategic location I had
chosen ... strategically in competition with two of the
best-known book dealers in the city!</p>

<p class='c014'>Only a block down the street was the Main Street Book
Store, already a fixture on the Avenue for a decade. A few
blocks farther south stood Kroch’s, Chicago’s largest bookseller
and one of the greatest in America, while north of
me the Michigan Avenue branch of Lyon and Healy, the
great music store, still flourished. And I thought what the
Avenue needed was Stuart Brent with his books and records!
Maybe it was, but the outlook did not seem propitious.</p>

<p class='c014'>Now, ten years later, Main Street and I are still selling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>books and not, I think, suffering from each other’s proximity.
Main Street’s orientation has always been toward
art, and they run a distinguished gallery in connection
with their business. Lyon and Healy eventually closed
its branch operation, and Kroch’s left the Avenue when
they merged with Brentano, an equally large organization
with which I have no family connection, on the Italian
side or any other. These consolidations, I am sure, were
simply manifestations of big business. If I were to fret
about the competition, it would be that of the dime store
next door, which sells books and records, too.</p>

<p class='c014'>In addition to the street-level floor, my new shop had
a fine basement room which I fitted out hopefully as a
meeting place. I immediately began staging lectures and
parties and put in a grand piano so we could have concerts,
too. Anything to bring in people. Business grew,
but as I soon found I would have to sell things besides
books in order to meet the overhead, I compromised on
long-standing principles and brought in greeting cards.
Within six months, I was also selling “how to do it books”—how
to eat, how to sleep, how to love, how to fix the
leaky pipe in your basement, how to pet your cat, how to
care for your dog, how to see the stars....</p>

<p class='c014'>By the time I had been on the Avenue a year, it was
hard for me to see how my shop differed from any other
where you might find some good books and records if you
looked under the pop numbers and <a id='corr88.29'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='best-sellers'>bestsellers</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_88.29'>bestsellers</a></span>. Apparently
some people still found a difference, however. In
his book <i>The Literary Situation</i>, <a id='corr88.31'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Malcom'>Malcolm</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_88.31'>Malcolm</a></span> Cowley, the distinguished
critic, wrote:</p>
<p class='c022'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>On Michigan Avenue, I passed another shop and recognized
the name on the window. Although the salesroom wasn’t large,
it was filled with new books lining the walls or piled on tables.
There were also two big racks of long-playing records, and a
hidden phonograph was playing Mozart as I entered (feeling
again that I was a long way from Clark and Division). The
books on the shelves included almost everything published
during the last two or three years that I had any curiosity about
reading. In two fields the collection was especially good: psychiatry
and books by Chicago authors.</p>

<p class='c023'>I introduced myself to the proprietor, Stuart Brent, and
found that he was passionately interested in books, in the solution
of other people’s personal problems, and in his native city.
Many of his customers are young people just out of college.
Sometimes they tell him about their problems and he says to
them, “Read this book. You might find the answer there.” He
is mildly famous in the trade for his ability to sell hundreds of
copies of a book that arouses his enthusiasm: for example, he
had probably found more readers for Harry Stack Sullivan’s
<i>An Interpersonal Theory of Psychiatry</i> than any other dealer
in the country, even the largest. Collections of stories are
usually slow-moving items in bookstores, although they have
proved to be more popular as paperbacks. One evening Brent
amazed the publisher of Nelson Algren’s stories, <i>The Neon
Wilderness</i>, by selling a thousand copies of the <a id='corr101.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='hard-cover'>hardcover</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_101.26'>hardcover</a></span> book
at an autograph party.</p>

<p class='c023'>We talked about the days when the Near North Side was
full of young authors—many of whom became famous New
Yorkers—and about the possibility of another Chicago renaissance,
as in the years after 1915. Brent would like to do something
to encourage such a movement. He complained that most
of the other booksellers didn’t regard themselves as integrated
parts of the community and that they didn’t take enough interest
in the personal needs of their customers.... Brent’s complaint
against the booksellers may well have been justified,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>from his point of view, but a visitor wouldn’t expect to find
that any large professional group was marked by his combination
of interest in persons, interest in the cultural welfare of
the community, and abounding energy.</p>

<p class='c023'>As a group, the booksellers I have met in many parts of the
country are widely read, obliging, likable persons who regard
bookselling as a profession and work hard at it, for lower incomes
than they might receive from other activities. They
would all like to sell more books, in quantities like those of
the paperbacks in drugstores and on the news stands, but they
are dealing in more expensive articles, for which the public
seems to be limited.</p>

<p class='c013'><i>The Literary Situation</i> was published by Viking Press
in 1954. I had met Mr. Cowley on a January evening the
year before. When he came in, tall and distinguished
looking, I had given him a chance to browse before asking
if I could be of assistance. He smiled when I offered my
help, then asked if I had a copy of <i>Exile’s Return</i>. I did.
He fingered the volume and asked if I made a living selling
books. “Of course,” I said, slightly miffed.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But who in Chicago buys books like the ones you have
on these shelves?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Lots and lots of people,” I assured him. I still didn’t
know he was baiting me. We began to talk about Chicago,
as I now saw it and as it had been. In a moment, he was
off on Bug House Square (Chicago’s miniature Hyde
Park), the lamented Dill Pickle Club, the young Hemingway,
Ben Hecht, Charlie MacArthur, Dreiser, Sherwood
Anderson, Archibald MacLeish, Sinclair Lewis. I had to
ask his name, and when he said, Malcolm Cowley, I took
<i>Exile’s Return</i> away from him and asked him to autograph
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>it to me. He took the book back and wrote: “To
Stuart Brent—a <i>real</i> bookstore.” I felt better about being
on the Avenue.</p>

<p class='c014'>The next evening, Mr. and Mrs. Cowley came to one
of our concerts in the downstairs room and heard Badura-Skoda
and Irene Jonas play a duo recital.</p>

<p class='c014'>America lacks the cafés and coffee houses that serve as
literary meeting places in all European countries. I had
high hopes for our basement room with its piano and hi-fi
set and tables and comfortable chairs as a place for such
interchange. In addition to our concerts, lectures, and
art exhibits, there were Saturday afternoon gatherings of
men and women from a wide range of professions and disciplines
who dropped in to talk and entertain each other.
We served them coffee and strudel.</p>

<p class='c014'>Possibly the most memorable of our concerts was that
played by William Primrose. He had promised long ago
to do one if I ever had a shop with the facilities for it. We
had them now, and quite suddenly Primrose called to
announce that he would be stopping over in Chicago on
his way to play with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
would be delighted to present us with a recital.</p>

<p class='c014'>There were only a few days to prepare for the event.
As soon as the word was out, we were deluged with phone
calls. Our “concert hall” would seat only fifty people, so
I decided to clear the floor on the street level, rent two
hundred chairs for the overflow audience, and pipe the
music up to them from the downstairs room. I hired a
crew of experts to arrange the microphones and set up the
speakers.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>The show did not start with any particular aplomb,
and it got worse, for me at least, as the evening progressed.
Primrose came early to practice. It hadn’t occurred to me
that he needed to. He wanted not only to practice, but
moreover a place in which he could do so undisturbed.
Since the “concert hall” was swarming with electricians,
not to mention the porter setting up chairs while I ran up
and down the stairs alternating between a prima donna
and a major domo, it looked as though another place
would have to be found for Primrose to practice. I therefore
took the great violist into a basement storage room
that served as a catchall shared by my shop and the
drugstore next door. But Primrose settled down happily
in the dirty, poorly lit room amid stacks of old bills, Christmas
decorations, old shelves and fixtures, empty bottles
and cartons of Kleenex and went to work.</p>

<p class='c014'>In less than ten minutes, a little grey man who filled
prescriptions came bounding down the stairs screaming,
“Where is Brent? Where is Brent?” He caught me in the
hall and continued yelling, “If this infernal racket doesn’t
stop, honest to God, I’ll call the police!” It was no use telling
him the man making the racket was one of the world’s
greatest musicians. He had never heard of Primrose and
couldn’t have cared less. The noise coming up the vents,
he claimed, was not only causing a riot in the drugstore,
but he was so unnerved by the sounds that he had already
ruined two prescriptions. While he was howling about
his losses, I began howling with laughter. But there
seemed nothing to do but get Primrose out of that
room.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>I moved my star into our receiving room, a messy cubbyhole
ten feet wide. He didn’t seem to mind, although now,
since he couldn’t walk up and down, he was confined to
sitting in a chair for his practice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meantime, a crowd far beyond our capacity had
swarmed into both levels of the shop. Those who came
early got seats. Others sat on the stairs leading down to
the hall. The rest stood, and some even spilled out the
door onto Michigan Avenue. I couldn’t get from one end
of the place to the other without stepping on people. I
found myself begging someone’s pardon all evening long.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then the complaints began. Those seated in the hall
were gasping for air. Our cooling system simply wasn’t
up to handling that many people. I rushed to the boiler
room where the gadgets for controlling the air-conditioning
were located and tried to improve the situation. Of
course, I made it worse.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally I introduced Primrose to the audience and beat
a hasty retreat. Almost at once an “important” guest
tackled me with his complaints. I beat my way upstairs
(those sitting on the stairs discovered they were not able
to hear a thing) and after tripping over dozens of feet and
crushing against uncounted bodies was confronted by a
thin, long woman wearing a turban hat, who seized me
and, amid this utter confusion, began telling me I was the
most wonderful man alive. Her eyes were burning and
every time she took a breath, she rolled her tongue across
her lips. I was fascinated, but desperate. “What do you
want?” I begged, willing to do virtually anything to extricate
myself. “I want you to be my agent,” she said, pressing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>me to the wall. “I’m an author and I’ll have nothing
to do with anyone but you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I ducked beneath her outstretched arms, trampled some
people, caught my foot in the lead wire to one of the microphones,
and fell heavily into the lap of one of the most
attractive women I have ever seen. She fell off her chair
onto the floor and I rolled on top of her. A folding chair
ahead of me collapsed, and before anything could be
done, a dozen lovers of music and literature lay sprawled
on top of one another, while those not engaged in this
chain reaction pronounced menacing “shooshes.” By the
time I had righted myself, several friends had come up
from the concert hall to complain about the noise upstairs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally the concert ended. I was later told that William
Primrose gave a brilliant performance—something to be
remembered and cherished for a lifetime. I would not
know. All I know is that the “most attractive woman in
the world” in whose lap I landed sent me a bill for eighty
dollars to replace the dress which I apparently had torn
beyond reconstruction. I paid the bill.</p>

<p class='c015'>There were other fine parties, among them one that
grew out of the arrival of a play called “Mrs. McThing,” a
funny, whimsical, adroit production which could be the
product only of a great goodness of the heart. Helen
Hayes and Jules Munshin were the stars.</p>

<p class='c014'>I loved every minute of the play, and in addition to being
entranced by Miss Hayes’ remarkable performance,
thought Jules Munshin to be extraordinarily comical in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>his role. One of his telling lines was, “Let’s have a meeting,”
no matter what the situation that provoked it. The
problem might be entirely trivial, but before a decision
could be made, a meeting first took place. As things do
happen, the morning after the play opened in Chicago,
Mr. Munshin walked into the shop along with another
member of the cast. It was impossible to greet him with
any other words, but, “Let’s have a meeting!” We became
friends instantly, and when the play neared the end
of its run, we decided there should be a farewell party for
the cast. Jules asked Miss Hayes if she would come, and
I was properly thrilled when she agreed.</p>

<p class='c014'>So on closing night they all came to the bookstore, along
with about thirty people Jennie and I had asked to join
us. The program did not have to be planned. There was
singing, reciting, story-telling. Then, quite by surprise,
Miss Hayes’ colorful husband joined us. The fun really
began, not only in heightened conversation, but when
the MacArthurs’ daughter sat at the piano with Chet
Roble and played and sang. Roble is another Chicago
“original”—an artist of the blues and a superb personality
and musician who has been playing over the years
at Chicago hotels and night spots and always attracts a
large and appreciative following. He was part of the cast
of <a id='corr95.26'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Turkel'>Terkel</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_95.26'>Terkel</a></span>’s famous “Studs’ Place” show. He represents an
almost lost art not only in his old-time jazz musicianship,
but also in terms of cabaret entertainment—the performer
who genuinely loves his work and his audience and
who will remember ten years later the face of someone he
met in a noisy night club crowd.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>It was an all-night party. I talked with Miss Hayes
about Ben Hecht, who had collaborated with Charles
MacArthur on “The Front Page,” which opened quite a
new page for the American theatre. She agreed that
Ben could talk more sense, more dramatically than any
author we knew. I had had an autographing party for
Ben’s book, <i>Child of a Century</i>, an autobiographical study
of his life and development as a writer. We sold almost
800 copies of the book that night. Ben came with his wife
and daughter and sat behind the desk with a cigar in his
mouth, his eyes dreamy, his mind tending toward some
distant land, but he was most affable, while repeating over
and over: “I’ve never done such a thing in my whole life.
And I’ve been writing for forty years!”</p>

<p class='c014'>Later Hecht had taken me to the old haunts of the Chicago
literary scene. We sat in a tavern he had frequented
while working on the now defunct <i>Chicago Journal</i>. He
showed me where Hemingway took boxing lessons. We
went to the building where Ben had lived on the fourth
floor and Hemingway on the floor beneath. It was a time
not long past, yet far away and long ago.</p>

<p class='c014'>We viewed the former locale of the Dill Pickle Club,
the famous literary tavern. Ben talked to me with personal
insight about Sherwood Anderson, Theodore Dreiser,
Maxwell Bodenheim, Covici Friede, and others, among
them, some of whose fame lay in tragic ends—death by
drink, suicide, or merciless twists of fate.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not long ago, I phoned Ben at his home in Nyack, New
York. Red Quinlan, the television executive, had an idea
for a series of literary shows to be called, “You Can’t Go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>Home Again.” He had talked to me about being narrator,
and I in turn had suggested Ben Hecht for the first interview.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ben,” I said, “this is Stuart Brent. Do you remember
me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>There was a flat, “Yes,” as though he didn’t, really.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m calling to tell you,” I said, “that we have a great
idea for a TV show and I want to interview you for it. It’s
called....”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t want to hear it,” he said. “I don’t want a living
thing to do with TV. Don’t tell me what you have to say.
I don’t want to hear it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute,” I said, “you haven’t given me a
chance.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I don’t want to give you a chance,” he said. “I have no
use for TV or anybody who writes for TV. It’s worse than
snaring little girls away from home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“You still don’t understand,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Look mister,” he said, “I understand. I just don’t want
to hear your proposition. I want nothing to do with you
or television. Is that clear?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Wait a minute, Ben,” I said, “this is Stuart Brent from
Chicago, don’t you remember?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Stu. Where are you calling from?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“From Chicago.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh my God. Why did you let me run off like that? I
thought you were some two for a nickel joker from a television
agency. I’m sorry. How are you, baby?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fine,” I said, “but I do want to talk with you about a
TV series that I hope I’m going to do.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Sorry, baby, the answer is no. Not for any money in
the world.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, how are you financially?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ach, you know. Same damn thing. But I don’t care.
I’m busy, killing myself with writing. I’ve got a hot book
coming out soon. Be sure and get a copy. It’s really hot.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish you’d hear what I have to say. It’s really a fine
idea.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Sorry, no. How’s the bookstore?”</p>

<p class='c014'>So we talked of books and the time I nearly blew a
gasket when Ben autographed his book, <i>Charlie</i>, at another
Chicago store. He had sent me a carbon copy of
his manuscript on that talented and lovable bum, Charles
MacArthur, and I had told him I hoped we could raise
a stir with a real party when the book came out. He
agreed, having been considerably impressed with the first
party we held for him. Ben was in Italy writing a movie
scenario when the publication date of <i>Charlie</i> was announced.
Upon receiving a cablegram requesting a Chicago
autographing party date, he wired, Yes, thinking it
was to be at my bookstore. It wasn’t ... and for weeks
after the event was held, nobody dared get near me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’m still sorry about that mixup,” Ben said. “Well, o.k.,
baby, take care of yourself. When you get to New York,
give me a ring and I’ll meet you for a drink at the Algonquin.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I remembered my original purpose and tried again.
“For the last time, you won’t listen to me about this TV
thing?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Absolutely, irrevocably, no. Goodbye, Stu.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>I was left pondering about the strange and rather terrifying
creature that is Ben Hecht, a wise, witty man of
the world with the disarming gentleness of a tamed jungle
beast. I thought again of our sentimental revisiting of
Hechtian haunts ... the small tavern across from Bug
House Square where Ben paced off the original setting:
“In this corner was a stage, here were the tables, and there
were the two chairs that belonged to Charlie and me.
Here, in this corner, we wrote <i>The Front Page</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Suddenly he put down his beer and said, “Let’s take a
taxi over to the campus. I want to show you where Carl
Wanderer lived.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We hadn’t traveled far before Ben changed the course
and directed the cab driver to let us off near the Civic
Opera building. We walked down a few stairs into another
tavern and Ben stood, cigar in mouth, looking. There
were a few men at the bar and the bartender, leaning on
outspread arms and returning Ben’s look inquiringly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you seen John Randolph or Michael Brown or
Rudy York?” Ben said.</p>

<p class='c014'>No one there had ever heard of them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ben muttered under his breath. “I guess they’re all
dead,” he said. “I used to work with them on the <i>Journal
American</i>.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We sat down and ordered a beer. “I think this must
be the place,” he said, “but I might have it mixed up. We
had good times together. We had a real ball with this
character, Wanderer. Do you know the story?</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, Wanderer was an ex-army officer who discovered
that his wife was pregnant. He didn’t want the child
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>because he feared it would interfere with resuming his
army career. He wanted to re-enlist. So he arranged for a
fake holdup on Ingleside Avenue. That’s where I want
to take you now.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Anyway, he got a bum off Clark Street and gave the
guy a few dollars to make this holdup, assuring him it was
just a trick to be played on his wife for fun. Wanderer
took his wife to the movies that night, to a theatre, if my
memory is correct, called the Midway. And on their way
home, they have to walk almost half a block along the side
of a school yard. The streets are poorly lit, and this bum
sticks a gun to Wanderer and yells, ‘This is a <a id='corr100.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='stickup'>stick-up</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_100.13'>stick-up</a></span>!’</p>

<p class='c014'>“The bum never had a real gun. But Wanderer did. He
pretended to struggle with the guy and then shot him ...
turned the gun on his wife, too, and killed her instantly.
Then he wiped off the gun and shoved it into the bum’s
dead hand. It looked as though the robber had been resisted
and somehow shot in the fight. Wanderer became
a hero overnight, and the newspapers played him up for
all it was worth.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Ben and Carl Sandburg, who was then a reporter on
the <i>Journal</i>, were eventually responsible for breaking
the case. They went to interview the hero and came away
with mutual misgivings which they confided to the police.
It was a triumph worthy of <i>The Front Page</i>, but I think
it was the irony of the world’s readiness for hero worship
that made pricking the Wanderer balloon such a satisfying
episode in the life of Ben Hecht.</p>

<p class='c015'>In spite of all our efforts, the lectures and concerts in
our downstairs room did not continue to draw indefinitely.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Sometimes we couldn’t get fifty people to come out of an
evening to hear good music for free (and one of the finest
chamber groups in the city was providing us with a series
just for the chance to play.) Saturday afternoons were
idle—people seemed to have become too busy to spend
time in simple conversation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Book sales dropped, too. Price cutting hurt the psychiatric
mail order business, although we held out for
several years. Finally we discontinued the catalogue, in
spite of its definitive value as a listing of significant books
in this field.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again, something new had to be done and done quickly.
I decided to go after business and industrial accounts
and to persuade them to give books instead of whiskey for
Christmas presents. My successes included selling a bank
250 copies of the Columbia Encyclopedia, with the name
of each recipient stamped in gold on the cover. I’m not
sure this did much for the human spirit, but it helped pay
the rent.</p>

<p class='c014'>One afternoon Ben Kartman came in with a friend who
had some ideas about Brent and television. They arranged
an audition, I was accepted, and for almost a year
I had a fifteen minute afternoon show, sandwiched between
a program on nursing and one on cooking. Financially
it was a disaster. I was paid scale, which at that
time was $120 per week, and after I paid my union dues
and my agent’s fees, most of the cost of the extra help I
had to hire to cover the shop during my absences came
right out of my own pocket. But I did learn this: be very
careful what you sign, re-read the small print, and be sure
to see your lawyer—lessons that would be helpful when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>television again beckoned in ways to be fully described
in another chapter.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every morning as I turned the key in the lock and entered
the shop, my heart sank. Each day brought trouble,
process servers, trips to the lawyer. This was what
came from entering a retail business without a financial
“cushion”—and especially a business that demanded a
large stock: for every book I sold, I had to buy three ...
three books it might take months to sell. Sometimes I
could visualize the credit managers sitting down for a
meeting—their agenda: Let’s Get Brent. There was
nothing to do but fight it out, worry it out, dream it out.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have said disparaging things about the publishing
industry and shall say more. But it was publishers and
their representatives who, in large measure, saw me
through. There was Robert Fitzhenry from Harper, now
some kind of an executive, then one of the top salesmen in
the business. He reminded one of Hemingway’s description
of Algren: watch out for him or he will kill you with a
punch. At one time you’d have thought from the titles on
the shelves that I was a branch store for Harper. There
was Joe Reiner from Crown Publishers, one of the first to
sell me books out of New York. He too has graduated into
the executive category. He taught me many things about
the book business, and it was he who arranged for me to
buy old book fixtures from the late Dorothy Gottlieb, the
vivid, marvelous proprietress of the Ambassador Bookstore.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bennett Cerf, master showman of the industry, gave
me a measure of prestige when I needed it by making me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>an editor, along with Jessie Stein, of the Psychiatric Division
of Random House. I was able to help their list with
a number of important works by Chicago analysts.</p>

<p class='c014'>Over the years people like Ken McCormick, Michael
Bessie, Pat Knopf, Jr., Ed Hodge, Richard Grossman,
Gene Healy, Peter Fields, Bob Gurney, Max Meyerson,
Bella Mell, Bill Fallon, and Hardwick Moseley became
more than business acquaintances and left their imprint
on my life as well as upon my adventures in the book
world. But more about that world later.</p>

<p class='c014'>As business improved and as the light gradually became
visible through the turbid waters in which I seemed immersed,
my energies became increasingly focused upon
the simple matter of keeping going, the business of each
day’s problems, each month’s decisions, each year’s gains.
Work and living have a way of closing in around one’s being
so completely that when fate strikes through this envelopment,
it comes as a stunning surprise. Fate does not
care for what has been the object of one’s personal concern,
and it seldom sends a letter or telegram to announce
its arrival.</p>

<p class='c014'>It had been just another day. Jennie had complained
of a headache and some difficulty in focusing. In the
afternoon we saw a doctor and in the evening an eye specialist.
Evidently it was not glaucoma. Nonetheless we
administered some eye drops and some pills. I fell asleep
in the living room in my chair that night and was awakened
early in the morning by three small children, vaguely
perturbed, dragging their blankets behind them. Jennie
was dead.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>Death is not saying goodbye. One can no more say
goodbye to death than to a statue or a wall. There is
nothing to say goodbye to. It is too natural and final to be
dealt with in any of the artificial, temporizing ways with
which we pretend to conduct relations with reality.</p>

<p class='c014'>My first impulse was to run—sell the store for whatever
I could get, pack up my things, and leave. Take off perhaps
for the little fishing village of Bark Point on the
Northern tip of Wisconsin where we had a summer place
and there retire in solitude and raise the children as best
I could.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Bob Kohrman who got me to quit trying to react
to death and to just go ahead and mourn. Death has
no face, is no audience, has nothing to do with reaction.
It is the life of the individual that demands everything,
cries out to be lived, and if mourning is a part of this, go
ahead. So I stayed where I was and worked and
mourned, until one day the pain of loss stopped altogether.</p>

<p class='c014'>Michael Seller had come over to the apartment one
night and talked to me. “For one thing,” he begged,
“don’t let irritations and problems pile up. Resolve them
from day to day. And another thing ... no matter what
the cost, come home every night for supper. Never let a
day or night go by without seeing your children and
talking with them.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I followed Mike’s advice to the letter. Every night I
was home for dinner at six o’clock, even though I might
have to leave later and return to the store. My routine
was established. I ate, slept, and worked, and after store
hours I gave myself to the problems that beset all parents
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>of small children: changing diapers and being concerned
over unexpected rashes and fevers in the night. I remembered
Tolstoy’s answer to the question: When is a man
free? A man is free when he recognizes his burden, like
the ox that recognizes its yoke.</p>

<p class='c014'>I learned that I was not alone. It was not only old
friends like Claire Sampson bringing over a turkey for our
dinner, or Lollie Wexler, early one wintry morning unbuttoning
the hood about her blonde hair and, flushed
with the cold and her own tremendous effort, saying ever
so softly, “Can I help?” It was also people I scarcely knew,
such as the strange man whose name I invariably forgot,
but who dressed so elegantly, a stickpin in his tie, his
moustache beautifully trimmed, a small flower in his lapel,
and who called everybody, “Kid.” He came in now on a
wet November night and bought some detective stories.
To my astonishment, when I handed him the books, he
began to weep. The tears were irresistible, so I looked at
him and wept also. “You’re a sweet kid,” he said, strangling,
and turned and left the shop.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was Marvin Glass, a genius at toy design, devoted
like Mann’s Herr Settembrini to the total encompassment
of human knowledge. I almost had to hire a girl
to take care of his special orders alone, dispatching telegrams,
night letters, even cablegrams for books he wanted
yesterday. He spoke in confidential whispers, but his expression
was always so precise that you invariably found
yourself watching carefully over every word you uttered
in response.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was Bert Liss, who wore the most beautiful coats
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>I had ever seen and a fantastic series of elegant hats: a
Tyrolean hat, a checkered cap, a Cossack fur hat, a dashing
black homburg. Whenever he went crazy over a book,
at least twenty of his friends would order a copy. But
more than that, he was a gentleman, firm in his belief in
the goodness of man.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sidney Morris, the architect who helped design the
interior of the shop (and never sent a bill) was there, not
only to buy, but more important, whenever I needed
someone to confide in. There was Oscar Getz—Oscar,
in vaguely Prince Albert dress, forgetting a life of business
<a id='corr106.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='ad'>and</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_106.13'>and</a></span> civic responsibility the moment he entered the world
of letters. Upon encounter with ideas, his eyes lit up and
his body began to quiver. There was no doubt about his
ability to entrance his listeners. Once, while driving him
home after an evening spent at a small <a id='corr106.17'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='cafe'>café</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_106.17'>café</a></span> listening to
gypsy music, I became so absorbed in what he was saying
that I was presented with tickets for two traffic violations,
one for failing to stop at a red light and another
for going in the wrong direction down a one-way street.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another scholarly business man, Philip Pinsof, came
in with his brothers, Oscar and Eddie, and together they
made it clear that I was being cared for. In later years I
was to enjoy Sabbath dinners at the Pinsofs’—where
Phil’s wife was a most gracious hostess who would seat
her husband on a red pillow, as if to say, “For five days
you have received the slings and arrows of the marketplace,
but on Friday night you are as a king in your own
home.”</p>

<p class='c014'>George Lurie came not only to buy books but to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>regale me with stories, such as the episode in which he attended
the board of governors meeting of a major university
and was invited to sign a book in which each guest
had inscribed not only his name but his alma mater.
George wrote his name in the book and cryptically added
H &#38; M. The gentleman sitting next to him asked, “Harvard
and what? Massachusetts Institute of Technology?”
“No,” said George, “Halsted and Maxwell”—the address
of Chicago’s famous and still extant open air market.</p>

<p class='c014'>Everett Kovler, president of the Jim Beam whiskey
company, made it clear to me that I could call him and
say, “Everett, I need a sale.” There were times when I
did, and he always replied, “Fine, send it.” Another official
of the same firm, George Gabor, was also my benefactor.
Through a strange twist of fate, he was able to
cancel a debt that plagued me, muttering under his
breath as he bought a book, “About that ... it’s all been
washed out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>While the kindness of my customers served to cheer
my heart no little, my peace of mind was greatly augmented
by the personal friendship and professional concern
of Dr. Arthur Shafton, the kind of pediatrician
who would come to the house at a moment’s notice to treat
bleeding or feverish children and soothe their hysterical
father, the kind of physician who views medicine as an
art. Sometimes when he dropped into the shop, he would
take me in hand too, suggesting, “Perhaps you ought to
go home now, you look tired.”</p>

<p class='c014'>For a brief time, I also thought I had found a gem of an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>office girl. She was certainly unique and physically striking:
a high breasted young creature at least six feet tall
who responded to instructions by taking a deep breath,
blinking her grey-blue eyes, and intoning, “Will do!”
Then she would wheel on her spike heels, pick up her
knees with an elevation that threatened to strike her chin,
and walk away, a marvel of strange symmetry. She was
the most obedient employee I ever had and the tidiest.
My desk was always clean as a whistle. But when the
time came for the month’s billings, I could find no accounts.
I rushed to Miss “Will do” in consternation. She
fluttered her lashes and said, “I threw them away.” That
was how she kept my desk so clean!</p>

<p class='c014'>As Christmas approached, the consideration and generosity
of my friends and customers became positively orgiastic.
Ruth Weiss called and said, “I’m telling everyone
I know to send books and records for Christmas,” and apparently
they did so. I have never seen so many art books
sold at one time as on the day Dr. Freund and his wife,
Geraldine, came in. Dr. Freund kept saying, “Lovely, I
must have it,” to everything I showed him, until I became
thoroughly embarrassed, and still he persisted in buying
more. Sidney Morris sent books to all his architect friends,
and the purchases of Morry Rosenfeld were so prodigious
that May Goodman, my floor manager, was left speechless.
The gentle Ira Rubel spent hours making copious selections,
saying quizzically of each purchase, “Do you
really think this is the most suitable?” A. N. Pritzker,
Jack’s brother, made one of his rare appearances, and
bought records—a little classical, a little operatic, a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>ballet, a little jazz, a little popular, until he had a stack
three feet high which he insisted upon paying for on the
spot, although we were really too busy to figure up the
amount.</p>

<p class='c014'>It went like this day after day, until my embarrassment
at so much kindness, and my inability to know what to
say or do about it, became almost too much. Late at night,
I would lie awake thinking about all these people rallying
about me. And then my embarrassment turned to humble
acceptance of so much caring, so much human warmth.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>9</span><br>Bark Point</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Whenever I travel, one thing is certain: that I will get
lost. Perhaps if I could remember which is my right hand
and which is my left, or tell north from south, I should be
able to follow directions more successfully. But it probably
wouldn’t help. I have an unfailing knack for choosing
the wrong turn and a constitutional incapacity for
noticing important signs.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was therefore not surprising that, on a summer twelve
years ago, while making my way toward Canada, I turned
up Bark Bay Road thinking I had found a short-cut and
very nearly drove off a cliff overhanging Lake Superior.
Berating myself as usual, I looked around and observed a
man working in a field not far from the road. He wore a
battered felt hat, a shirt open at the neck, heavy black
trousers supported by suspenders, and strong boots. His
eyes were sky blue and his weathered skin, brown as a
nut, was creased in a myriad wrinkles on the neck and
about the eyes. When I approached and asked him how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>to get to Canada, he replied in an accent that I could not
place. His speech was rapid and somewhat harsh in
tonality, but his manner was cheerful and friendly, so I
paused to chat with him. He said he was preparing his
strawberry field for next year.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is beautiful country,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Ya, it is that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I wish I owned some of it,” I said. “I think I could live
here for the rest of my life.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well, this land belongs to me. I might sell you an acre,
if you like.”</p>

<p class='c014'>As we walked across the field toward the bay, he said,
“Are you a son of Abraham?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I had never been called anything that sounded quite
so beautiful. “Yes, I am a son of Abraham,” I said proudly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My name is Waino,” he said. “I am a fisherman. But
I own this land.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Trees, grass, and water ... there was nothing else
to be seen, except a small house covered with flowers
and vines a quarter mile across a clover field. “Who lives
there?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“My brother-in-law, Mike Mattson. He might sell you
his house,” Waino said.</p>

<p class='c014'>I met the Mattsons. Mike looked kindly. His eyes were
grey rather than blue, but his skin was as deeply brown as
Waino’s, with as many crinkles about the eyes. Waino’s
sister, Fanny, wore a kerchief about her head, tied with a
small knot beneath her chin. She spoke little English and
our business transaction was often <a id='corr111.39'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='interupted'>interrupted</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_111.39'>interrupted</a></span> while Mike
translated for her in Finnish.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>I bought the house and an acre of ground. The house
had only two small rooms, no running water, no toilet.
This didn’t matter. Like the room that originally housed
the Seven Stairs, <i>I wanted it</i>. I had the identical feeling:
no matter what the cost, or how great the effort and sacrifice
that might be entailed, this place must be mine. My
soul stirred with nameless wonder. I felt lifted into the
air, my life charged with new purpose and meaning. I
put down one hundred dollars as earnest money, arranged
a contract for monthly payments, and became a part of
Bark Point.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bark Point is located at the northernmost corner of
Wisconsin. At this writing, exactly five people live there
the year around. In summer, the Brents arrive, and our
neighbors, Clay Dana, Victor Markkulla, Robert McElroy,
Waino Wilson and the Mike Mattsons, swelling the total
population to as many as fifteen adults and children. The
nearest town, Herbster, is six miles away. Farther south
is the town of Cornucopia, and to the north, Port Wing.
Thirty-five miles off the coast of Lake Superior stand the
Apostle Islands, and beyond, Canada. It is about as far
from Michigan Avenue as you can get.</p>

<p class='c014'>This new habitat which I grasped so impulsively provided
a kind of spiritual nourishment which the city did
not offer. And later when I married Hope, she responded
as eagerly as I had to the benign sustenance of this isolated
sanctuary.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not only the natural beauty and quiet remoteness
of the locale, but also the strength that we find in association
with our neighbors, whose simplicity stems not from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>lack of sophistication, but from the directness of their relations
with the forces of life and nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is John Roman, who lives in Cornucopia, the tall,
thin, master fisherman of the Northern world. He is gentle,
shy, and rather sensitive, with the courage of one who
has been in constant battle against nature, and the wisdom
given only to those who have endured the privations
and troubles and disappointments of life completely on
their own. Now well into his seventies, he fishes a little
for pleasure, cuts pulp to make a few dollars, and spends
much of his time listening to foreign news reports on his
short wave radio.</p>

<p class='c014'>When he stops by for his glass of tea, he never comes
empty handed. There is always something wrapped in a
newspaper to be presented to you in an off-hand manner,
as though to say, Please don’t make a fuss about this ...
just put them in your freezer until you are ready to eat
them. The package, of course, contains trout. When no
one else can catch trout, John Roman can. He knows
every lake and river and brook and he uses nothing but
worms to bait his handmade fishing rod and gear. So
far as John is concerned, there isn’t a fish swimming that
won’t take a worm. He has caught trout that weighed
fifty pounds, and once he tangled with a sturgeon that
wanted to carry him to the bottom of the lake—and could
have.</p>

<p class='c014'>The sturgeon encounter occurred about eight miles
from our house on a lake called Siskwit that is filled with
walleyes, bass, some smaller pan fish, and sturgeon. One
morning while fishing alone in his boat, John thought his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>hook had caught on a sunken log or rock. He edged the
boat forward slowly, dragging the hook, but nothing gave.
He moved the boat backward. Still no give. Finally John
had a feeling that he could reel up. He could, but only
very slowly. Then all at once, the sturgeon came straight
up from the water, looked at John, then dove straight
down, and the boat began to tip and go down, too. John
promptly cut the line. He is a regular Old Man of the Sea,
but he found no point, he said, in trying to land a fish
weighing perhaps two hundred pounds. The thing to do
when you are outmatched is cut the line.</p>

<p class='c014'>John has met the problems of his own life, but the reports
of the world concern him. The danger of Fascists
appearing in the guise of saviors of democracy worries
him. He senses that men are losing their grip on values
and are in for a hard time. But what he cannot understand
are the reasons for moral apathy. If an “ignorant”
man in the North woods can see trouble at hand, is it possible,
he wonders, that others do not?</p>

<p class='c015'>Bill Roman is one of John’s sons and the husband of
Waino’s only daughter, Lila. Bill used to run the filling
station in Cornucopia. Now he builds houses. But his
real genius lies in his understanding of boats and the water.
He would advise me: “Look at the barometer every
morning before you go out and believe it. If you’re
caught in a sudden squall, slow the motor and head for
the nearest shore. Don’t go against the wind. Stay in the
wake of the waves. Don’t buck the rollers and don’t be
proud. Keep calm and get into shore no matter where it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>might be.” Bill is known for fabulous skill in getting out
of tight squeezes, and his advice is good enough for me.</p>

<p class='c014'>He is also the only man I have known who could properly
be described as innocent. His philosophy of life is
built upon an utter incapacity to be moved by greed or
ambition. “Just live,” he keeps saying. “Just live. Don’t
fight it. Don’t compete. If you don’t like what you are
doing, change. Don’t be afraid to change. Live in harmony
with what you are and what you’ve got. Don’t fight
your abilities. Use them. I like living and I like to see
others live.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Bill tries to get on, so far as possible, without money—and
with Bill that is pretty far. “I try to never think about
money,” he says. “When you start thinking about money,
you get upset. It hurts you. That’s why I like Bark Point,
where we can live simply. I got my health, my wife, my
boy. I got my life. I don’t believe in success or failure. I
believe in life. I build for others and do the best I know
how. I listen to music on the radio. I go fishing. Every
day I learn something. Books are hard to come by here,
but I have re-read everything we’ve got. And I love the
winters here better than the summers. In the winter we
can see more of our friends and sit and talk.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But money is evil. Money and ambition. Money always
worries me. I’m glad I’m without it. I have enough
without it. What I want, I can have. But the secret is to
know what to want.”</p>

<p class='c015'>Over the years, we built additions to the house until
there were enough bedrooms for all of us, a sitting room
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>with a magnificent fireplace, and even a Finnish bathhouse,
called a sauna. We enjoy taking steam baths and
have discovered the children do, too.</p>

<p class='c014'>Raspberries and blueberries grow by the carload in
our field, there are apples on the trees and Sebago Salmon
in our lake. This particular salmon is a landlocked
fish, generally weighing between five and six pounds and
very handsome. His skin is covered with silver crosses, he
has a short, hooked mouth, and his flesh is orange. He is
caught by trolling.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few miles from our house are rivers and streams seldom
discovered by tourists. Hence we can catch rainbows
weighing four and five pounds and browns often
weighing more. We have lakes where we can catch
northerners weighing twenty, thirty, forty pounds, and
walleyes by droves. We can take you to a lake where you
can catch a fish in one minute—not very big, but a
variety of pan fish seldom seen or caught anywhere
else. We can take you to a trout stream where you can
fish today, come back next week, and find your footprints
still in the sand, utterly unmolested.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is a land of beauty and plenty, but nature is not soft.
Sometimes a Northeaster will blow for five days at a time.
Then you can stand at the window and watch the lake
turn into something of monumental ferocity, driving all
human endeavor from the scene. Trees are uprooted, windows
are smashed, telephone wires and power lines are
downed. Lightning slashes, the rumbling of thunder is
cataclysmic, and the rain comes. Often Waino would
call and warn of an impending storm and the necessity of
securing the boat with heavy rope. But sometimes it was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>too late, and we would have to go out in the teeth of the
early storm to do battle, rushing down the beach in our
heavy boots, heads covered with oilskins, beating against
the rising wind whose force took the breath out of you.
But the roaring surf, the lashing rain, the wind tearing at
every step, are tonic to the blood!</p>

<p class='c014'>One night while standing at the window watching the
hard rain falling on the Bay, I was suddenly alerted to action
by the sight of water rushing over the embankment
which we had just planted with juniper. The torrent of
water washing away the earth was obviously going to
carry the young juniper plants along with it. There was
only one thing to do and it had to be done at once: cut a
canal in the path of the onrushing water to channel the
flood in a different direction.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope was napping. I awoke her, and armed with shovels,
we pitted ourselves against the storm. At once we
were up to our ankles in mud. Hope’s boots stuck and,
being heavy with child, she was unable to extricate herself.
My tugging only made matters worse and, with
shouts of anguish, we both toppled over into the mud.
But no damage was done and, muddy from head to foot,
wallowing in a slough of muck, laughing and gesturing
and shouting commands at each other, we got on with
cutting the canal. It was mean work, but there was something
exhilarating about it all and, when the challenge
was successfully met and we were in by the fire, quietly
drinking hot chocolate, a kind of grave satisfaction in
knowing that this was in the nature of things up here and
that we had responded to it as we should.</p>

<p class='c014'>Bark Point is a good place for growing children as well
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>as for tired adults. It is good for children to spend some
time in a place where a phrase such as “know the score”
is never heard, where nobody is out to win first prize,
where nobody is being urged continually to do something
and do it better, and where the environment is not a constant
assault upon quietness of the spirit. Children as
well as adults need to spend periods in a non-communicative
and non-competitive atmosphere. I am opposed to
all those camps and summer resorts set up to keep the
child engaged in a continuous round of play activities,
give the body all it wants, and pretend that an inner life
doesn’t exist.</p>

<p class='c014'>At Bark Point, our children can learn something first
hand about the earth, the sky, the water. They plant and
watch things grow, build and watch things form. There
is no schedule and no routine, but every day is a busy day,
filled with natural activities that spring from inward urgings,
and the play they engage in is something indigenous
to themselves.</p>

<p class='c015'>Before the lamprey eels decimated the Lake trout,
most of the men in the Bark Point area fished for a living.
Years ago, I was told, Bark Point boasted a school, a town
hall, a general store, even a post office. But now commercial
fishing is almost at an end—the fine Lake Superior
trout and whitefish are too scarce. So the bustle of the
once thriving fishing village is gone, along with the anxious
watch by those on shore when a storm comes up. No need
for concern now. Let it blow. No one is fishing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Almost no one. But the few remain—marvelous, jolly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>fellows, rich with earthy humor, strong, dependable,
completely individualistic. Every other morning they
take their boats far out in the lake and lift the Pon Nets.
It is dangerous work, and thrilling, too, when from two
to three hundred pounds of whitefish and trout are caught
in one haul.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nearly everyone is related and most of the children
have the same blue eyes and straw hair. But the children
grow up and discover there is nothing for them to do.
Fishing is finished, and about all that is left is to cut pulp
in the woods or become a handy man around one of the
towns. Farming is difficult. The season is so very short
and considerable capital is required to go into farming on
any large scale. Nobody has this kind of money.</p>

<p class='c014'>Then, too, the old folk were beginning to hear for the
first time a new theme: the work is too hard. For a time,
this filled them with consternation. But they recognized
the sign of the times and even came to accept it. The
young people no longer were interested in working fifteen
and sixteen hours a day as their fathers had. They left
their homes and went to Superior or Duluth or St. Paul or
much farther. The few that remained stayed out of sheer
bullheadedness or innate wisdom. It was an almost deserted
place when I found it, and it has remained so all
these years.</p>

<p class='c014'>Those who stayed became my friends and their world
is one I am proud and grateful to have entered. I have
played cribbage and horseshoes with them, gone with
them on picnics and outings, fished all day and sometimes
late at night. We have eaten, played, and worked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>together, but most important to me has been listening to
them talk. Their conversation is direct, searching, and
terribly honest. Many of their questions bring pain, they
strike so keenly upon the wrongs in our world. I am used
to answering complicated questions—theirs possess the
simplicity that comes directly from the heart. Those are
the unanswerable questions.</p>

<p class='c014'>I would often sit with them in dead silence around
the fire, five or six men dressed in rough clothing, their
powerful frames relaxed over a bottle of beer or a glass of
tea, each lost in his own thoughts. But this silence wasn’t
heavy—it was an alive silence. And when someone
spoke, it was not to engage in nonsense. Never have I
heard commonness or cheapness enter into their conversation.
When they talked, what they said had meaning.
It told something. A cow was sick. An axle from a car or
a truck or a tractor broke. The nets split in two. Soon the
herring season will be upon us. What partnerships will be
entered into this year? The weather is too dry or too
rainy. Someone is building a shed or a house. Someone
cut his thigh and needed thirty stitches. Someone needs
help in bringing in his hay.</p>

<p class='c014'>In this world that is entirely elemental, each man
wrestles with the direct necessities of living. This is not
conducive to small talk, to worrying about losing a pound
or gaining a pound or figuring out where to spend one’s
free time. When there is time for relaxation, the talk usually
turns to old times, fables of the world as it “used to
be”—the giant fish once caught: rainbows weighing fifty
pounds, browns weighing seventy, steelheads by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>droves. And behind all of this lies the constant awareness
that Lake Superior is an ocean, never to be trifled
with, never taken for granted.</p>

<p class='c014'>The women are strongly built and beautiful, with low,
almost <a id='corr121.6'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='singsong'>sing-song</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_121.6'>sing-song</a></span> voices. Their “yes” is a “yah” so sweetly
inflected that you want immediately to imitate it, and
can’t. Their simple homes are handsomely furnished
through their own labors. When I dropped in, unexpected,
I was certain to receive a quiet, sincere greeting
that put me at ease and assured me I was no intruder.
There would be a glass of tea or coffee and a thick slice
of home-made bread spread with butter and a variety of
jams. Nearly everything in the household was made by
hand, all the clothing, even the shoes. And just about
everything outside the household, too, including the fine
boats.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even today it is possible to live like a king at Bark
Point on fifteen hundred dollars a year—under one
condition: one must learn to endure loneliness and one
must be capable of doing things for himself.</p>

<p class='c014'>The people around Bark Point have radios and television
sets, automobiles and tractors and other machines.
But the people come first, the machines second. Bark
Point people do not waste time questioning existence.
They laugh and eat and sleep without resorting to pills.
They have learned to renounce and to accept, but there is
no room in their lives for resignation and pessimism. However,
they do suspect that the world outside is mostly populated
by madmen, or, as one of my neighbors said to
me, “What do you call dogs that foam at the mouth?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>When I go to Bark Point, it occurs to me that what the
world needs is more private clubs, more private estates
and exclusive residential areas, more private centers of
entertainment, anything that will isolate the crass from
the mainstream of life and let them feed upon themselves.
Anything that will keep them away from the people of
Bark Point.</p>

<p class='c015'>The master builder of Bark Point is a seventy-seven
year old man named Matt Leppalla. When one asks Matt
a question, his invariable reply is, “I’ll look of it.” “Look of
it” means that he will measure the problem, work it in his
mind, and provide the answer. He lives in a house built
entirely by his own hands. If he needs a tool for a job and
no such tool exists, he invents it. His energy and capacity
for sustained work is amazing for a man of any age. He
has built almost everything we possess at Bark Point.</p>

<p class='c014'>A few summers ago, we decided to build a dock to
protect our beach and secure our boat against the fierce
Northeaster. So Matt and I took the boat and set out to
look for logs washed up on the shores of Bark Bay. There
was no hesitation on Matt’s part as we hurried from log
to log. “Good,” he would say, “this is cedar. No good, this
is poplar. This is good. This is Norway pine. No good,
this is rotten in the middle.” And so from log to log, Matt
in the lead with the canthook on his back and with me following
behind, trying as hard as I could to keep up.</p>

<p class='c014'>When the selection had been made, Matt offered to
teach me how to tie the logs so we could tow them over
the lake to our shore. It looked easy, but it required an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>almost occult knowledge of weights and forces to determine
exactly the right place to tie the rope so the log
would not slip and jam the motor or slam against the side
of the boat. Everything there is to be known about leverage
Matt knows, including the most subtle use of ropes
and pulleys for least expense to the human back.</p>

<p class='c014'>The building of the crib for our dock was one of the
wonders of the world, executed with the quickness and
sureness of a man who knows and loves what he is doing.
Or if any difficulty arose with material too stubborn to
bend to his thinking, I could virtually see him recast his
thought to fit the situation.</p>

<p class='c014'>Matt is slight of build and the eyes behind his spectacles
are sparkling blue. When he first got the glasses, they
were not fitted to his satisfaction, so he improved them by
grinding the lenses himself. He reminds me in many ways
of my own father, who had a bit of Matt’s genius and versatility.
When I see Matt work, I seem to see my father
again ... building, planning, dreaming, trying to make
something out of nothing.</p>

<p class='c013'>Ervin owns the general store in Herbster. Every week
he drives his truck to Duluth for supplies, carrying with
him a frayed, pocket-sized notebook in which he has written
down everything people have asked for. Once I had
a chance to look through this notebook which Ervin treasures
with his life. Only Ervin could possibly know what
was written in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ervin’s capacity for eating is marvelous to behold.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>While the children stare at him in petrified wonder, he
will put together a sandwich of cheese, sausage, fish, butter,
meat balls, even strips of raw meat. His capacity for
work is equally limitless. He is a powerful man and can
wrestle with bags of cement all day long. But he cannot
catch fish! At least that is his story and his claim to fame
in the area: never to have caught a fish that amounted to
anything. I don’t believe a word of it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ervin fights many of the same business battles I have
fought with no capital and extended credit. He worries
about it, but the odds are a challenge to him. You cannot
long endure at Bark Point unless you are capable of meeting
challenges.</p>

<p class='c014'>In addition to his appalling eating habits, Ervin chews
tobacco and is a horrifying master of the art. He showed
our boys the full range of techniques employed for spitting
out of a fast-moving truck, and they thought it was
wonderful. But he has also taught them all about the
bears and deer and foxes and wolves and other wild life
that abound in our forest. He helped me with the plans
for our house, with the boat, with the art of reading a
compass, and with the geography of the myriad lakes and
streams hidden throughout the area. Ervin knows everything
and says very little. He is easy to be with, and a
solid friendship based upon mutual respect has grown between
us.</p>

<p class='c014'>When spring begins to come, something that has been
kept buried in our winter hearts can no longer be suppressed.
The children start saying, “We’ll be leaving for
Bark Point soon, won’t we?” One spring day when the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>children were on vacation from school, I packed the boys
into the car and we set out for an early visit to our spiritual
home. The day of our arrival was clear and beautiful.
The ice had gone out of the Bay and clumps of snow remained
only here and there. New grass was coming up
from the steaming earth. There were pink-flecked clouds
in the sky and a glorious smell everywhere that filled us
both with peace and exhilaration.</p>

<p class='c014'>But early the next morning it began to snow, coming
down so thick and fast it was a sight to behold. My exclusively
summer experience of the North Country
warned me of nothing. We delighted in the snowy wonderland
seen from the snugness of the house, and bundled
up in heavy clothes and boots to go out and revel in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>It snowed all through the night. On the following
morning, it seemed to be coming on stronger than ever.
I phoned Ervin—fortunately the telephone lines were
still working. He thought the snow might stop by evening.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How are your supplies?” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Still o.k.,” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What about fuel?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Waino gave me a supply of wood and brickettes for
the stove yesterday.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Have you got enough?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes—so far.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Good. As soon as it stops, I’ll be up with the truck.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But the snow did not stop. The following day it lay ten
feet high and was still coming.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ervin called again. “The roads are closed,” he said. “I
can’t get to you. Can you hold out?”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Yes,” I said, “but I’m starting to cut up the furniture
for the stove and I’m worried about the children.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ll come up the minute I can get there,” he said, “but
I can’t do nothing about it yet.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It snowed for three days and three nights without a
letup. I tried to keep awake, dozing in a chair, never daring
to let the fire go out. We had long since run out of
fuel oil, but luckily we had the wood-burning cook stove.
I broke up two tables, all the chairs, and was ruefully
contemplating the wooden dresser. The phone had gone
dead and we were completely isolated.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was night, the snow was up to the windows and it
was still coming on—a dark world shot with white flecks
dancing and swirling. The whole thing seemed completely
impossible. But it was happening and there was
nothing to do but wait it out.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had no milk, but there was water and a small supply
of tea and coffee. There was flour, too, and we made bread
... bread without yeast or salt. It tasted terrible, but we
ate it and laughed about it. I read or played cribbage
with the boys. They played with their fishing reels, oiled
them, took them apart, put them back together, took them
apart again. We waited.</p>

<p class='c014'>The morning the snow stopped we were greeted by
bright sunlight hot on the window panes. Everyone
jumped up and down and yelled, “Yay!”</p>

<p class='c014'>But how to get out of the house? We were snowed in
completely.</p>

<p class='c014'>About noon, Ervin called. The lines were fixed and
Bill Lloma was working like crazy with his tractor opening
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>the Bark Bay Road. Everyone had been alerted to
our plight and help would be on the way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several more hours passed. We were without food or
fuel, and I still hated the idea of chopping up that dresser.
Then all at once our savior was in sight: Ervin in his truck,
way down the main road and still unable to get anywhere
near our driveway.</p>

<p class='c014'>There was no restraining the children in their excitement.
The yelling and shouting was enough to waken the
dead. I found myself laughing and yelling, too, and waving
madly to Ervin. We were all behaving as though we
were going to a picnic instead of getting out of a frightful
jam.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally Bill came lumbering up the road with his snow
plow and in fifteen minutes cut a huge pathway to the
house. We came out and danced around Ervin’s truck as
it backed slowly into the driveway.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Where’s your car?” Ervin asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>We had to look around—it was completely buried. I
had even forgotten I had it. Working together, we cleared
the snow away. I tried starting the motor, but nothing
happened. Ervin attached a chain to the car and pulled
it up the road. This time the motor turned over, but so
suddenly (and my reflexes were so slow) that, before I
knew it, the car had swerved off the wet road into a ditch.
I was fit to be tied.</p>

<p class='c014'>Getting the car onto the road from the muddy embankment
took an hour. Finally it was done and all was
well. We retired to the house and made a feast of the supplies
Ervin had brought, eating as though we were never
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>likely to see food again, building Ervin-style sandwiches
and consuming them with Ervin gusto. Occasionally Ervin
would cast around and say something droll about the
absence of chairs and having to sit on the edge of a dresser.
Everything seemed hilariously funny. It was the best
party I ever had.</p>

<p class='c015'>When June arrives, we organize our caravan and steal
away in the early hours of the morning: six children, the
maid, two cats, three birds, two Golden Retrievers, Hope
and I and all the luggage, packed into a station wagon.
Gypsies have to get out of town while the city sleeps.</p>

<p class='c014'>At first our spirits are high. The babies, Amy and Lisa,
play or sit quietly. Then restlessness sets in. David and
Jonathan become fidgety. David playfully slaps Jonathan,
and the battle begins. I lose my temper and bawl
at both of them. Then Lisa gets tired and tries to sleep
on Hope and Amy and me in the front seat. Now Susan
wants some water, and David calls out from the back of
the wagon, “I’m sick.” Amy now wants to sleep, too, so
in the front seat we have: me at the wheel, Lisa, Amy,
Hope, and Big Joe in Hope’s arms. In the center of the
car are Susan, the maid, and the two dogs; in the back,
David and Jonathan, the birds and the cats, and everything
that we couldn’t tie on top in the luggage carrier.</p>

<p class='c014'>But we are off! And amid confusion and frayed nerves—and
much laughter, also—we share a secret joy, a
gypsy joy, and the knowledge that our spiritual refuge
lies ahead and so many useless cares and dehumanizing
pressures drop farther and farther behind us.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Bill Roman, who has made an art of living life simply,
worries about the inroads of those who seem determined
to despoil what remains of this crude but civilized outpost,
where I have learned so much about what is truly human.
He is concerned about the hunters who come up from the
big cities to slaughter deer and leave them rotting in the
fields. They are only on hand a short while, with their
shiny boots and gaudy jackets and their pockets full of
money, but they create nothing but noise and havoc.
When they finally leave, Bark Point repairs the damage,
but each year it is a little worse. In a few more years, Bill
fears, Bark Point could become a resort town like Mercer
or Eagle River. If it does, he says, he’ll move to Canada.</p>

<p class='c014'>Personally, I don’t think we can afford to surrender any
more outposts—in our culture and in the remnants of
community living that still center around values that
make for human dignity. I still say: Let the despoilers
feed upon one another. Encourage their self-segregation,
away from the mainstream of life. Even give them junk
books, if that is all their feeble moments of introspection
can bear. But never, never surrender.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>It was only after I had been on television and begun
receiving letters from viewers that I realized how seriously
interested people are in the personal lives of others.
Curiosity about one’s immediate neighbors is not intense
in a large city. Often you do not see enough of them
to get curious. You see more and know more of public figures
than of the person in the next apartment. Curiosity
about people in public life can become ridiculous when
exploited by press agents. But wanting to know more
about someone whom you have become interested in as a
public personality is as sincere and natural as the wish
to know more about the lives of those with whom you
have become acquainted in a more personal way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, it was a surprise to me when people wrote to ask
who and what I was, where and how I lived, and all about
my wife and children. A surprise, but not an affront, for
when I receive such letters, I have exactly the same curiosity
about those who write them. I really would like to
know all about them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>My personal life began on the West Side of Chicago.
<a id='corr131.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='we'>We</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_131.2'>We</a></span> lived at 1639 South Central Park Avenue, a neighborhood
of houses and trees and good back yards. In our
back yard we even had a duck pond with a duck in it,
not to mention the flowers and the grass that my father
tended so lovingly. My father was a tool and die maker.
He could speak and read several languages with ease, had
a marvelous sense of humor, and revered greatness. He
believed in two things: love and work. He mistrusted
those who did not.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although my father died several years ago, my mother
is alive, and now in her late eighties. In the sixty-five years
of her life in this country, she has seldom left the kitchen,
yet she knows more about the human heart, about human
weakness and suffering, and about human caring than I
shall ever know. She is gentle and kind, and her adage to
me since childhood has been: Keep out of mischief—as
sound a bit of wisdom concerning conduct as you are
likely to find anywhere, not excluding Spinoza.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was an alive neighborhood, populated by people of
mixed origin, although predominantly Jewish. There was
plenty of activity on our street: kids practicing on horns,
playing fiddles, playing games—mostly baseball and
peg and stick. Peg and stick may require a bit of explanation
for the present younger generation. To start the
game, it is necessary to steal a broom. This is always
done with the confident expectation that this article is
something your mother will never miss. Cut off the handle,
so you have a stick about twenty-two inches long.
Also cut a seven inch peg. Now go out in the street and
with your penknife make a hole in the asphalt. In summer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>the pitch is tacky, so this is no problem. Stand by the
hole and, using the stick as a bat, knock the peg down the
street. Then mark the hole by putting the stick in it. Your
opponent must now take the peg, wherever it lies, and toss
it toward the stick. The place it falls is marked, and, of
course, as the turns go around, whoever gets the peg
closest to the hole wins the point.</p>

<p class='c014'>But most of all there was an awful lot of talking—on
the streets, on the corner by the delicatessen, and among
people sitting on their front porches. Talk ... and lots
of laughter. And there were great good times at home,
especially in the evenings when my father told stories of
his sojourn in Europe, or his adventures in America, or
his day-to-day experiences at work.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was the youngest child in a family of six children,
and my life revolved around such matters as dogs, reading,
and poetry. I had my own dog, but I also
caught every stray dog in the neighborhood, washed and
defleaed it, and anointed it with cologne (causing a great
rumpus when discovered by one of my sisters from whom
the cheap scent had been appropriated). My poetical
labors were not properly appreciated by my sisters, either,
who would collapse into gales of laughter when I interrupted
their bathroom sessions of beauty culture to read
them my latest verses.</p>

<p class='c014'>My father built me a study in the basement and I set
up a program of studies for myself: chemistry one week,
physics the next, then mathematics, philosophy, etc. It
was a wonderful thing until I blew the place up in the
course of my chemical experiments. This ended my
career in the physical sciences.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>One summer I painted our house—a complete exterior
paint job utilizing only a one and one-half inch
brush. It took me from June to September, and finally
the neighbors were complaining to my mother about the
way she was working me. They didn’t know that I was in
no hurry to finish the job. It was not only a labor of love
so far as the painting went, but I was spending my time
up there in a glory of memorizing poetry and delivering
noble dissertations.</p>

<p class='c014'>I was seldom seen without a book, and nobody regarded
this as particularly odd, for the sight of young
people reading on the streets, on their porches, on a favorite
bench in Douglas Park was common. It is not common
today. The only wonder is that I never toppled off a
curb or got killed crossing a street—one read as he
walked and paid little attention to the hazards of city living.</p>

<p class='c014'>Furthermore, nobody told us, in school or elsewhere,
what a child between the ages of nine and twelve should
be reading and what he should read from twelve to fourteen,
etc. We read everything that took our fancy,
whether we understood it or not, from Nick Carter to
Kant and <i>Penrod and Sam</i> to Joyce. And when we became
infatuated with some writer, we stopped barely
short of total impersonation. When I read that Shelley
had carried crumbs in his pocket, I started to do likewise
and practically lived on breadcrumbs for days.</p>

<p class='c014'>All of us who grew up in the Depression years on the
West Side remember vividly the men out of work and the
soup kitchens going on Ogden Avenue; houses and apartments
becoming crowded as married sons and daughters
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>moved in with their families. People stayed home and listened
to the radio: Wayne King playing sweet music from
the Aragon Ballroom and Eddie Cantor singing that potatoes
are cheaper, so now’s the time to fall in love.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went to school with the heels worn off my shoes and
sat in class with my overcoat on because there were two
holes in the seat of my pants. When the teacher asked a
question, I would reply with a sermon. I spent my days
fuming ... I hadn’t found myself. One day I encountered
the works of Schopenhauer and felt I had at last arrived
at an idea of life on a highly negative plane. A
short time later I presented my whole schema to a friend,
who blew it up completely.</p>

<p class='c014'>My formal education was quite diverse. I never went
to school without working to foot the bill and in the course
of time did about everything, it seems, except selling shoes.
I was an usher at the Chicago Theatre (a vast, gaudy
temple of entertainment then featuring elaborate stage
shows as well as the latest movies), where I eventually became
Chief of Service. I was an errand boy and a newspaper
boy (selling papers on the corner of Wabash and
Van Buren for a dollar a night, seven o’clock to midnight).
I worked in a grocery store, a hardware store, a department
store. I was a bus boy and a dishwasher. I sold
men’s clothing, worked at the University of Chicago, and
wrote squibs for a neighborhood newspaper. I went to
Crane Junior College, to the old Lewis Institute, and
attended graduate courses at the University of Chicago.
And during all this, I took courses in every field that captured
my imagination or provoked my curiosity: neurology,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>philosophy, psychology, literature, sociology, anthropology,
languages (German, especially) ... everything.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day, while I was still an undergraduate, a professor
whose heart I had captured through my ability to
recite from memory the <i>Ode to the West Wind</i>, took me
aside and assured me that if I were to be a teacher of literature,
which he suspected would be my goal in life, a
faculty position in a college or university English department
was not likely to come easily to a man named Brodsky.
Frankly, it was his suggestion that Stuart Brodsky
find another last name—at least if he wanted to become
an English teacher. “What name?” I said. “Any other
name that seems to fit,” he replied.</p>

<p class='c014'>I took the suggestion up with my sisters. We thought
Brent might do nicely. Then I asked my father for his
opinion. He told me that no matter what I did with my
name, I would still be his son and be loved no less. It was
settled. At the age of nineteen, my name was legally
changed to Brent.</p>

<p class='c014'>Brent or Brodsky, I taught incipient teachers at the
Chicago Teachers College. Then I lectured on Literary
Ideas at the University of Chicago’s downtown division.
The world took a nasty turn and I left teaching to enter
the Armed Forces. I spent twenty-seven months in the
army, becoming a Master Sergeant in charge of military
correspondence under Colonel Jack Van Meter. When a
commission was offered me, I asked for OCS training and
got it. But toward graduation time, the prospect of
signing up for two more years as a commissioned officer
was too much and I rejected it. The war was over. I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>on my way to the vagaries of civil life and to becoming a
bookseller.</p>

<p class='c014'>The Seven Stairs was born, grew, died. I found myself
a widower, endeavoring to maintain my sanity and my
household and fighting for commercial survival on Michigan
Avenue.</p>

<p class='c014'>One day in 1956 a tall, pretty redhead named Daphne
Hersey grew tired of her job in one of the dress shops on
Michigan Avenue and came to work for me. She was a
Junior League girl, but a lot else beside. Before I knew
it, we had three Junior Leaguers working in the shop, and
I was wondering whether the shop was going to be swept
away in an aura of sophistication that was incomprehensible
to me. But my respect for Daphne and her integrity
remained limitless. And I had no notion of the improbable
consequences in the offing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nothing is easier than saying hello. The day Hope
walked in to chat with Daphne, the world seemed
simple. She and Daphne had attended Westover together.
They had grown up in the same milieu. Daphne introduced
Hope to me. I was three years a widower, absorbed
in my problems of family and business. Hope was a young
girl struggling to stay really alive, teaching at North Shore
Country Day School, living in the token independence
of a Near North Side apartment shared with another
girl. We chatted for a moment or two about books, and I
sold her a copy of a more than respectable best-selling
novel, <i>By Love Possessed</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>Summer was coming. I was intent upon taking my
children up to Bark Point. I would spend a week or ten
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>days with them, leave them there with the maid and return
for two weeks in the city. Then back again to the
Lake. This was my summer routine. But Daphne wanted
a vacation, too, and we were short of help. While we were
discussing this dilemma, in walked Hope. Daphne asked
her what she was doing during her vacation from kindergarten
teaching. Nothing. And would she like to work
here for three weeks? Hope accepted. The next day I
left for the Lake. When I returned, Daphne would leave,
and by that time Hope would have learned her way
around. Together with our other girl in the shop, we
could hold the fort until Daphne came back. It was as
simple as that.</p>

<p class='c014'>When, in due time, I returned, Daphne left and Hope
and I were thrown pretty much together. I loved working
with her, and she seemed thrilled with the bookstore.
It was a courtship almost unaware, then a falling in love
with all our might. And the probability of a good outcome
seemed almost negligible.</p>

<p class='c014'>There <i>is</i> such a thing as “society.” It is not a clique or
gilded salon of arts and letters such as a Lionel Blitzsten
might assemble, but an ingrown family, far more tribal
than what is left of Judaism. In point of fact, the old West
Side no longer exists—its children, our family among
them, are scattered to the winds. But the North Shore,
beleaguered perhaps, is still an outpost of the fair families
of early entrepreneurs, a progeny of much grace anchored
to indescribable taboos.</p>

<p class='c014'>The plain fact is, it calls for an act of consummate
heroism to withstand real hostility from one’s family. It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>is not only a matter of the ties of love. It is a matter of
who you are, finding and preserving this “who” ...
and you may lose it utterly if you deny your family, just
as you may lose it also by failing to break the bonds of
childhood.</p>

<p class='c014'>Even when people try to be understanding and decent,
they can be tripped by their vocabulary. In the protective
and highly specialized environment in which Hope was
raised, anti-Semitism was as much a matter of vocabulary
as of practical experience. Even the mild jibes of pet
names often involved reference to purported Jewish traits.
This atmosphere is so total that those who breathe it
scarcely think about it.</p>

<p class='c014'>This beautiful and vital girl with whom my heart had
become so deeply involved, brilliant and well-educated,
loved and admired by family and friends, could not possibly
make the break that our relationship would call for
without the most terrible kind of struggle. Hope’s parents
were dead, but she had an aunt and uncle and a sister and
brother. Their reaction to my impending descent upon
their world was one of violent shock and bitter protest.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope’s relatives were vitally concerned about what she
was getting herself into. As if I wasn’t! I think if they
had pointed out to her that, in addition to being Jewish, I
had three small children, that there was an age difference
involved, and that she herself might be running away
from some nameless fear, they would have stood a better
chance of prevailing. But the social impossibility of the
case seemed to be the overwhelming obstacle.</p>

<p class='c014'>If it were all really a dreadful error, I could only pray
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>that Hope might be convinced of it. I was afraid of marriage.
I couldn’t afford a love that was not meant to be. I
had to think not only of Hope and me, but of the children—they
couldn’t be subjected to another tragedy. There
mustn’t be a mistake.</p>

<p class='c014'>To me, it was a terrible thing to have to remain passive,
to ask Hope to shoulder the whole burden of our relationship.
We sought out a psychoanalyst to help us—one I
had never met socially or in a business way (not easy; I
knew nearly all of them on a first name basis) and who,
if at all possible, was not Jewish. I did find such a man
and Hope arranged to see him. He gave her the facts
about the risks involved in marrying me. He also gave
assurance that she was neither neurotic nor in need of
analysis. And that threw the whole thing right back to
Hope again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope left the city to hold counsel with herself. I
stayed and did likewise, on the crossroads of my own
experience. We had a hard time of it ... and love won
through, feeding, obviously, on struggle, obstacles, impossibilities,
and growing all the better for it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I am sure God was beside me when I married Hope.
Since then, everything I do seems right and good. We do
everything together ... my life is empty when she is
gone even for a few days. Hope’s brother and sister have
learned that the “impossible” thing, social acceptance,
does not interest me, but that there are other areas of living
equally important. We are friends.</p>

<p class='c014'>Life with love is not without struggle. The struggle is
continuous, but so is our love for each other and our family.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>With the addition of Amy Rebecca, Lisa Jane, and
Joseph Peter, the Brent children now number six. It gives
us much quiet amusement to hear parents complaining
about the difficulties of raising two or three. Hope is responsible
for naming Joseph Peter, our youngest. “He
looks so much like you and your family,” she said, “I think
it would be very wrong if we didn’t name him after your
father.” And so we did.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>
  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>11</span><br>My Affair with the Monster</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Among the things I have never planned to be, a television
performer ranks pretty high on the list.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have already mentioned that the unlikely person who
initiated my relationship with the new Monster of the
Age was the wise and kindly Ben Kartman. Ben by this
time had left <i>Coronet Magazine</i> and was free lancing in
editorial and public relations work. I had not seen him
for some months when he came into the shop with a public
relations man named Max Cooper. Except for having
heard of instances in which they purportedly exercised
a dangerous power over gossip columnists, I knew nothing
about PR boys. I simply regarded them as suspect.
Consequently I should probably have taken a dim view
of the idea they came in to talk with me about—auditioning
for a television program—even if I hadn’t been
opposed on principle to television.</p>

<p class='c014'>At the time, it seemed to me that television was the
most vicious technological influence to which humanity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>had been subjected since the automobile’s destruction of
the art of courtship as well as the meaning of the home.
The novelty of TV had not yet worn off, and it was still
a shock to walk into a living room and see a whole family
sitting before this menacing toy, silent and in semi-darkness,
never daring to utter a word while watching the
catsup run in some Western killing. I vowed that I would
never own a piece of apparatus which seemed so obviously
designed to diminish the image of man, enslave
his emotions, destroy his incentive, wreck his curiosity,
and contribute to total mental and moral atrophy. I
didn’t think it would be good for the book business, either.</p>

<p class='c014'>Ben and Max didn’t sell me on television, but they did
make the audition seem a challenge. What could I do? I
had never taken a lesson in acting or public speaking in
my life. When I spoke extemporaneously, I often rambled.
In fact, that was my approach to talking and to
teaching. Sticking to the subject never bothered me ...
or breaking the rules; I didn’t know any of them. I just
talked. All I had was a spontaneity springing from a love
of ideas and of people. I laid these cards on the table as
carefully as I could, but Cooper’s only response was, “You
are a raw talent. I’m sure you can make it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Make what? On the morning of the auditions, I arrived
at the Civic Theatre (an adjunct to the Chicago
Civic Opera House which at that time had been taken
over as a television studio—this was while Chicago was
still active in the game of creating for the medium) and I
was as nervous as a debutante on the threshold of her
debut. A hundred men and women were standing in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>wings, and the fact that I knew some of them and had
sold them books made matters worse. All at once, I knew
that I was at war with them all. I was competing for a role
and I had to be better than the rest.</p>

<p class='c014'>We were instructed to come out on the stage at a given
signal, peer toward a camera marked by two red eyes,
and talk, sing, dance, or perform in our fashion for three
minutes. By the time my turn came up, I was ready to
fall on my face from sheer nervous exhaustion. The red
lights blinked on, and I began to talk. I talked for three
minutes and was waved off.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had had enough lecture experience to feel the incompleteness
of such an experience. No audience, no response,
no nothing, just: your three minutes are up (after
all the tension and readiness to go out and perform). I
hurried out of the theatre and back to the store, where I
paced around like a wild beast. I was certain that I had
failed. Everything that I had been building up for
seemed cut out from under me, and I could only talk to
people or wrap their packages in a mechanical daze.</p>

<p class='c014'>At five o’clock in the afternoon the spell was broken.
Max came in along with a towering young man of massive
build who extended a huge hand toward me, crying, “Let
me be the very first to congratulate you. You have a television
program for the next thirteen weeks!”</p>

<p class='c014'>At my total astonishment, he threw back his head and
emitted a Tarzan laugh. I liked him very much, but I
could not place him at all. He was Albert Dekker, an
actor who has probably appeared in more Western movies
than any other star and who at that time was acting in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>play in Chicago. He was a friend of Cooper’s and subsequently
a friend of mine, frequently accompanying me
to the television studio during the remainder of his run
in Chicago.</p>

<p class='c014'>But at that moment I could only sputter and stutter
and wheel around as though preparing for a flying leap,
and the next few minutes gave way to complete pandemonium,
as everyone shared in my sudden good fortune.</p>

<p class='c014'>The show ran for more than thirteen weeks. It lasted a
year. It was sandwiched between a show about nursing
and one about cooking. It was a fifteen minute slot, but in
the course of this time I had to do three commercials—opening
refrigerators and going into the wonders thereof,
selling cosmetics, even houses. It was a mess. During the
entire year, nobody ever evinced any interest in building
the show, and when it was finally cancelled, I was torn
between hurt pride and recognition of an obvious godsend.
Now and then I had received a small amount of
critical acclaim, but on the whole, my first venture into
television seemed a disaster, financially as well as spiritually.
And I hate failure.</p>

<p class='c014'>Well, there was no use apologizing. I had had my
chance, a whole year of it, and I didn’t make the grade.
The poor time slot, the overloading of commercials were
no excuse. I could lick my wounds and say, “Nothing
lasts forever. Television is television. They squeeze you
out and throw you out.” But in my heart I knew that the
show had never had an audience because it was not good
enough. So it ended in failure, and along with it, my relations
with Max Cooper.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>For two years, I was away from television entirely, except
for an occasional call from Dan Schuffman of WBKB
asking me to pinch hit for someone who was taken ill.
Among those for whom I served as proxy was Tom Duggan,
a real good guy who developed considerable local
fame by getting into one scrap after another and finally,
after getting into the biggest scrap of all, practically being
deported from Chicago to pursue the same career in
Southern California where he continues to be a nightly
success.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although it seemed to me from time to time that glimmerings
of creativity could be detected in the television
field, I no longer had any serious interest in the medium.
When, shortly after Hope and I were married, we gave
an autographing party for Walter Schimmer, a local TV
and radio producer who had written a book called, <i>What
Have You Done for Me Lately?</i>, the TV relationship was
incidental to the objective of boosting a Chicago writer.
One of the guests at the party was the station chief of
WBKB, Sterling (Red) Quinlan. I had previously met
him only casually and was surprised to be drawn into a
literary conversation with him, during which he told me
that he was working on a book, to be called, <i>The Merger</i>.
The next day, he sent me the manuscript to read and I
found it most interesting, particularly as it dealt with a
phase in the development of the broadcasting industry,
about which Quinlan, as an American Broadcasting Company
vice president, obviously knew a great deal. This
was a period during which any number of novels with a
background of Big Business were being published. I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>thought Quinlan had done an unusually honest job with it
and wrote him a note to this effect when I returned the
manuscript.</p>

<p class='c014'>Several weeks later, I received a phone call from
Quinlan which sounded quite different from the tough-minded
executive of my superficial acquaintance.
“What’s wrong with my book?” he said. “No one wants
to publish it.” He really wanted to know where he had
gone wrong.</p>

<p class='c014'>I tried to explain the vagaries of publishing and of publishers’
tastes and how it was a matter of timing and
placement with certain publishers who publish certain
types of things. But I could see this made little sense to
Quinlan, because there is really not much sense <i>in</i> it.
Finally I said, “Look, send the book over. You need a front
runner. Maybe I can break down a door for you.” I’m
sure he didn’t believe me, but he sent the book over anyway.</p>

<p class='c014'>I sent the manuscript to Ken McCormick, editor-in-chief
at Doubleday, after phoning to tell him about it,
and as luck would have it, Ken liked the book and made
an offer. I’m sure Quinlan thought I was some kind of
wizard, and of course I was delighted to have been able
to help.</p>

<p class='c014'>With Red’s book in the process of being published, I
turned my mind to other matters—mostly the sheer joy
of living. Business was strong, Hope and I were enjoying
the best of good times, we were soon to have a child, we
were floating on a cloud and wanted no interference from
anything. I avoided phone calls and invitations and put
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>away all thoughts of becoming anything in the public
eye. I just wanted to be a good bookseller, earn a living,
spend time with my family, and leave the world alone.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was in this frame of mind that I received a call one
day from Quinlan asking me to join him for lunch at the
Tavern Club (a businessmen’s luncheon club located
near the WBKB studios). I was interested in Red’s literary
ambitions and was glad to accept.</p>

<p class='c014'>Red Quinlan is more than a typical example of a
“pulled up by my own boot straps” success story. He is a
fairly tall man with reddish hair, a white, smooth face,
and blue eyes that can change from pure murder to the
softness that only Irish eyes can take on. He knows
every way to survive the jungle and moves with the
slightly spread foot and duck walk of a man treading a
world built on sand. One part of his mind deals only
with business; the other part is dedicated to a sensitive
appreciation of the written word and a consuming desire
to write a good book. At the beginning he may have
wanted to make the best seller list, but his concern is now
with truth and craftsmanship and with what it means to
be a writer. He is a fascinating man who has done much
for me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Two other men joined us for lunch at the club. One
was a heavy-set man of Greek descent named Peter
DeMet who controlled large interests in the television
world. The other was Matt Veracker, general manager of
WBKB. We ate a good lunch and talked in generalities
until Quinlan asked me if I had read any good books
lately. I had just finished a collection of short stories by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>Albert Camus and was particularly taken by a piece
called, “Artist at Work.” As I told the story, DeMet
seemed suddenly very interested. But the conversation
went no further. We shook hands all around and broke
up.</p>

<p class='c014'>Less than an hour later, Quinlan called me at the shop
and asked me to come right over to his office. I could tell
as I walked in that something was on the fire. Red came
around the desk and sat down with me on the couch.
“Stuart,” he said, “we have an open half hour following a
new science show that the University of Chicago is sponsoring.
How would you like to have it?” This was in 1958
when astro-physics had burst upon the public consciousness.
Hence the science show.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I’ve even thought of the name for your show,” Quinlan
continued. “Books and Brent.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I still remained silent, caught in an enormous conflict.
I <i>did</i> want the show ... to prove something to myself.
But at the same time I didn’t want to be bothered, I didn’t
want to get caught up in the hours of study the job entailed.
And I no longer needed the money or a listing in
the local TV guides to bolster my ego. Yet I wanted the
chance again.</p>

<p class='c014'>Red noted my hesitation and, although slightly nettled
by my lack of enthusiasm, recognized that I was not
giving him a come-on. He went to the phone and said,
“Ask Dan Schuffman to step in here.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Danny took over the argument. The price was set, with
promise of a raise within twelve weeks. The show would
run from September through June, no cancellation clause,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>no commercials sandwiched in to break up the continuity
of my presentation. I had complete control over
the choice of books and what I would say about them.
Everything was settled. Now all I had to do was tell
Hope!</p>

<p class='c014'>It wasn’t easy. Hope knew something was on my mind
and refrained from asking about it until the children were
in bed. Then I told my story. It would be five days a
week at the frightening hour of eight o’clock in the morning.
Hope took the whole thing in and accepted the situation.
But we both had strong misgivings.</p>

<p class='c014'>I went to work. Each book had to be read and pondered
the night before I reviewed it. Asking myself of
each volume what in essence it was really about, what
meanings and values it pointed to, was the crux of the
matter and a most difficult undertaking. Every morning
I delivered my presentation and then ran to the bookstore.
I came home at six, had dinner, and started preparing
for the next morning. It was impossible to entertain
or to see friends, and I was half dead from lack of sleep.
Finally, to lessen the strain of five shows a week, Red
suggested that Hope appear with me on the Friday shows
for a question and answer session, cutting the formal reviews
to four a week. Again it took some persuading—Hope
would have nothing to do with it unless she
“looked” right, “sounded” right, and could offer questions
that were sincere and significant. She did all of these
things superbly and for the next three years appeared
with me every Friday.</p>

<p class='c014'>Still, it was a grueling task. I wanted to give the very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>best I could each day, and I felt that I was being drained.
But what was really killing my drive was the suspicion
that I was working in a vacuum. After all, who could be
viewing my dissertations on the problems of man and the
universe at eight in the morning? I decided it would
probably be appreciated all around if I quit like a gentleman.
So one morning, after about eight weeks of giving
my all to what I judged to be a totally imaginary audience,
I <a id='corr150.9'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='interupted'>interrupted</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_150.9'>interrupted</a></span> whatever I was talking about and said,
“You know, I don’t think anyone is watching this program.
I’m very tired of peering into two red eyes and
talking books just for the sake of talking. I believe I’ll
quit.”</p>

<p class='c014'>What I really meant to say, of course, was, “If anyone
is watching, won’t he please drop me a note and say so.”
But it didn’t come out that way. I walked out of the studio
thinking it was all over.</p>

<p class='c014'>To my great astonishment, Quinlan soon reached me
by phone at the shop, saying, “What are you trying to do?
Get me killed? The phone has been ringing here all morning
with people demanding to know why I’m firing you!
Did you say that on the air?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I hastened to explain and told him what I did say. The
following day hundreds of letters arrived. I suddenly
realized that I had an audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope and I were thrilled and went to work with renewed
vigor. The mail continued to grow. At eight a.m.
people were viewing and listening and, of all things, writing
to me—not only housewives, but also teachers, librarians,
doctors, lawyers, occasional ministers.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Newspaper columnists became interested and reviews were
flattering to a point where I was afraid I might begin to
take myself seriously.</p>

<p class='c014'>Another thing was also happening. Although I never
mentioned on the air that I had a bookstore, people began
to call the store asking for books I had reviewed. Other
bookstores found that Books and Brent was stimulating
their business, and some of them, particularly in outlying
areas, took it upon themselves to write notes to the publishers
about what was happening. I began to wonder if
what the book business needed generally wasn’t a coast
to coast TV bookshow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Not long after these thoughts had formed in my mind,
Pete DeMet asked me to come and see him at the hotel
where he was staying. When I arrived, I found his room
filled with men ... some kind of important meeting was
just breaking up. Finally they dispersed and I was able
to sit down with Pete. He told me he wanted to create a
TV book of the month show, which he was ready to back
to the hilt. He would investigate the possibility of getting
the major publishers to pay for some of the time—the
rest would be sold to other sponsors. Apparently he and
his organization had the genius required to market such
a thing. In any event, his gospel was “success” and he
evidently saw in me another way to be successful.</p>

<p class='c014'>I always had mixed reactions to this powerful, heavy-faced
man with his white silk shirts and his, to me, mysterious
world of promotional enterprise. He had been in
the automobile business and subsequently acquired ownership
of successful network shows, particularly in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>sports field, and no one seemed to doubt that he could
do anything he set his mind to.</p>

<p class='c014'>He was always forthright in his relations with me. He
boasted that he had never read a book and never intended
to, but he saw in my work a vision of something
he wanted to be part of. But he also insisted: “If I take
you on, I own you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Contracts were being drawn up, but Hope and I decided
that although the amount of money being offered
me—$130,000 for nine months of work—seemed
extraordinary, the only thing to do was to turn the offer
down.</p>

<p class='c014'>So I went to see Pete and told him the deal was off. The
money was wonderful, but so was my marriage, my personal
life. I couldn’t see myself catching a plane to the
West Coast on a moment’s notice, only to be told that I
was heading for the East Coast the following week. There
might be some excitement in such a frenetic pace, but I
was getting too old for that sort of thing, and I didn’t
need the pace and the noise to persuade me that I was
living.</p>

<p class='c014'>My would-be benefactor looked at me as though I had
gone out of my mind, but he let me go without any further
badgering.</p>

<p class='c014'>By this time I had become more than a little intrigued
with the Frank Buck approach to capturing live talent.
On the next occasion DeMet pressed me to sign the contract,
he assured me that I wasn’t nearly as good or important
as I thought I was. They were not at all certain,
he said, of my “acceptance” in various markets, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>furthermore there was threat now of replacing me altogether:
some people felt that a Clifton Fadiman or a Vincent
Price with a “ready-made” or “built-in” audience
would be distinctly preferable to someone completely
unknown outside of Chicago. It would take a lot of adroit
PR work to build up the ratings for an unknown.</p>

<p class='c014'>I couldn’t contradict him, and happily I did not feel
smart-alecky enough to tell him, “Go ahead and get those
fellows if you think they can bring a book to life better
than I can.” I simply refused to sign without the consent
of my wife.</p>

<p class='c014'>That night I was in the midst of reporting the day’s
events to Hope when the phone rang. Hope answered.
It was for me: Pete saying, “Can I come over? I <i>must</i> see
you now.”</p>

<p class='c014'>A half hour later Pete was with us, going through the
entire proposition and concluding by saying, “You’ll do
everything I tell you to do, and you’ll make a fortune.
We’ll all make money.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope looked Mr. DeMet squarely in the eyes and said,
“Money isn’t the God of this household and at the moment
I can’t say I enjoy being here with you.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the stunned silence that followed, I was seized with
a feeling of terrible embarrassment over our attacking
Pete DeMet on a level so totally removed from his frame
of reference or the very principles of his existence. A
few minutes later, Pete got his hat and left. I was sure
the whole thing was finished.</p>

<p class='c014'>As it happened, it was just the beginning. One of our
best friends, in or out of television, was the late Beuhlah
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>Zackary, producer of “Kukla, Fran and Ollie” and as fine
a spirit as I have ever known. She used to say to me, “If
I can only discover exactly what makes you tick, I’ll
make you a household name throughout the nation.”
Had she lived, I’m convinced she would have done it. In
any event, it was Beuhlah at this point who saw merit
lurking somewhere beneath the high pressure and convinced
Hope and me that we should explore the matter
further. Finally we consented to go ahead, provided Jack
Pritzker act as our attorney and read every line of every
paper (including the dotting of i’s and the crossing of t’s)
before it was signed. Things were agreed upon to everyone’s
satisfaction, and I was in the Pete DeMet organization.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had confided in Hardwick Moseley at Houghton
Mifflin about the enterprise and he wrote to me (in
March of 1959): “I do hope the DeMet deal on Books
and Brent goes through and that you get your rightful
share of the plunder. You know I always expected something
like this. I am delighted that it is happening so
soon. When you get time why not let me know a little of
the detail. If we can get you on in the high grass and a
variety of stations everywhere it will be the best thing
that has happened to the book business in years because
you do sell books.”</p>

<p class='c014'>It seemed a long time since Hardwick had lifted me
from the depths by writing me that I <i>had</i> to remain a
bookseller, no matter what.</p>

<p class='c014'>But everything fell through from the very beginning.
The money Pete hoped to raise from the publishing industry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>failed to materialize at all. Television does not sell
books, the publishers chorused. From my end, I was assailed
by doubts because I was never invited to present
the proposition to the publishers with whom I was most
intimately acquainted. From Pete’s end, there was anger
and frustration when the industry would not buy something
which he was convinced might prove their economic
salvation. He decided to look for other markets.</p>

<p class='c014'>Production was scheduled to start in September. But
by this time other things had taken precedence over
Books and Brent. Pete entered into a real estate promotion
to develop a kind of Disney wonderland in New York
called Freedom Land. His lawyer, Milt Raynor, wrote to
me in flattering terms about myself and the book project,
but indicated that for the time being the undertaking
would have to be shelved.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a letdown. But the irony of the thing was that a
promotional genius like Pete could be so fascinated by the
publishing field and what might be done for it, and then
so totally discouraged by the supineness, invincible ignorance,
and general reluctance of an enormous, potentially
very profitable industry to take even modest advantage
of the only advertising medium that might bring it before
the public. Pete found only one publisher actively encouraging.
The rest were negative.</p>

<p class='c014'>This was the idea they were offered: I was to review,
on a network show, books selected by myself from the
lists of all publishers. In our experience in Chicago, although
I rarely, if ever, suggested that anyone rush
down to his neighborhood bookstore (if any) and buy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the book in question, every bookstore in the area felt the
impact of my lectures. The instances in which my own
store sold hundreds of books in a week because of a review
I had given were fantastic—and more frequently
than not the very large downtown stores considerably
outsold my own shop on the same volume, for I was not
engaged in self-advertising. This is something unique
in our day, but not in publishing experience, for Alexander
Woollcott used to have the same effect through his
radio broadcasts. He was, of course, a national figure
... but not in a popular sense until he went on the
radio. Publishers were aware of all this, but they were
not convinced.</p>

<p class='c014'>Pete was convinced. He believed in me because he
saw the results of the job I was doing in a very difficult
city and saw no obstacle to doing at least as much in
other cities. He was an entrepreneur, but perfectly willing
to try the idea of wedding television to culture. Actually,
I was never a party to any of the planning, any
of the strategy, any of the meetings held with publishers
or their representatives. To this day, I know nothing of
what actually went on. I was just the talent, and all I
knew was that there was a clause in the contract that
required Pete to put the show on the road no later than
September 30, 1959, or else I was free to return to my
local television commitments. The option was not picked
up, and that was that.</p>

<p class='c014'>As I mulled the whole thing over at Bark Point, a comment
of my father’s kept running through my mind:
“When is a man a man? Only when he can stand up to
his bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Of course, there was no saying whether the luck was
really bad—only that what I envisioned for the future
was certainly being held in abeyance. I came back for
another year of Chicago television, much like the year
before, except for the feeling that I was bringing more
experience to it.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was the letters that kept me persuaded I was right.
In spite of the hour, with wives kissing husbands off to
work and mothers frantically preparing breakfast and
dressing children for school, people were listening and,
in increasing number, writing. Greater numbers of people
were searching for answers to forgotten questions, or
driven, perhaps, back to fundamental questions and to
restating them. Hope and I found all this mail a tremendous
stimulus. We returned to our city routine. Every
evening I came home from the bookstore, had dinner,
played or talked with the children, then sat down to read,
while Hope read or knitted or mended or listened to
music. At midnight we took a short walk to the corner
drugstore with Mr. Toast, our Golden Retriever, and had
a cup of hot chocolate. These moments were the best of
the whole day.</p>

<p class='c014'>Getting to the studio in the morning was never easy,
and on Fridays when we made the mad rush together it
was more than usually frantic. Hope is not easy to
awaken and would be engaged, more often than not, as
we raced across the street like maniacs toward our
parked car, in the final acts of dressing, zipping up her
skirt, straightening her hair, trying to find her lipstick.
Sometimes we barely made it ahead of the cancellation
period—five minutes before showtime, but we always
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>managed. Then when the ordeal was over, it was perfectly
delicious to go out for coffee, swearing solemnly,
absolutely, never again would we oversleep ... until
the next time.</p>

<p class='c014'>But why were we doing it? The financial rewards for
an unsponsored, sustaining program simply bore no relation
whatever to the effort involved. Finally Quinlan
called me in and suggested that since the networks didn’t
seem interested, it might be a good idea to form an organization
and see if I couldn’t sell the show myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hy Abrams, my lawyer and tennis partner, and his
brother-in-law, David Linn, often used to ask why I didn’t
do anything about promoting the show, to which my answer
normally was: “Do what?” But now, with Red’s insistence,
I had a feeling that perhaps the time was ripe.
Perhaps in the present era of political, economic, and
spiritual confusion, people might be becoming worried,
harassed, clipped, chipped, agonized enough for a return
to reading. They might be susceptible.</p>

<p class='c014'>David was all for it, and we called a meeting, bringing
together, as I recall, Ira Blitzsten, Sidney Morris, Adolph
Werthheimer, and my brother-in-law, Milton Gilbert. I
made the presentation, outlining not only the prospect
but also the likelihood of absolute failure. Together we
created the Stuart Brent Enterprises and hired a man to
run the show. Again the idea was to sell the thing to the
publishing industry. The project hardly got off the
ground, yet our case seemed an extremely sound one.</p>

<p class='c014'>To begin with, we surveyed a thousand letters that had
been written to the Books and Brent show. A summary
of the survey showed:</p>

  <ul  class='survey'>
    <li><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Of the 1000 letters read, 705 or 70.5% had bought one or more books due to
    Stuart’s review. Some writers had bought as many as ten books. Many listed the books
    bought and several enclosed sales slips.

    </li>
    <li class='c004'>Of the 1000 letters read, 107 or 10.7% planned to buy in
    the near future. Many of these pointed out the difficulties of buying books in the
    suburbs, where there are few bookstores.

    </li>
    <li class='c004'>Of the 1000 letters read, 188 or 18.8% wrote “keep up the
    good work” type of letters. There were requests for book lists, particularly from
    librarians. A number suggested starting a book club.

    </li>
    <li class='c004'>Libraries, bookstores, and publishers were represented. The
    letters showed a good cross section of the community, both economically and age-wise.
    </li>
  </ul>

<p class='c015'>David Lande, of Brason Associates, a distributing
agency for publishers, helped the cause by writing to Mac
Albert, of Simon and Schuster, a letter that said: “While
this may not be news to you, I thought you might be interested
in knowing that the Stuart Brent book review
program has caught on like ‘wildfire’ in this area. Our
personal experience has been that Stuart Brent has made
more best sellers than Jack Paar. If this is good information
for you, use it—if not, we’re still good friends.”</p>

<p class='c014'>I went to New York and had an opportunity to talk
with Mr. Simon, of Simon and Schuster, along with other
editors, publishers, and booksellers. Mr. Simon said, “I
like you because you are not interested in the I.Q. of man,
but in his C.Q.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What, sir,” I said, “is the C.Q.?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“His cultural quotient,” he replied. Then he said:
“The book business is exploding. We have a lot of new
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>schools, a lot of new libraries. So long as we believe that
a child must attend school until eighteen years of age,
we will need a great many textbooks. People are hungry
for a lot of new things. Books are one way of appeasing
that new hunger. No matter where you go or how small
the community, you will usually find a new library building
and new schools. The book business has a new, great
future. We need more good writers to fill the need for
books these days. That’s our problem, finding new writers,
good writers.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Most of the major New York publishers and some of
the smaller ones bought time on Books and Brent to help
initiate its showing on WOR-TV. The pre-taped half-hour
shows made their debut simultaneously in New
York and Los Angeles on September 12, 1960. In the October
26 issue of <i>Variety</i>, the showbusiness weekly, Thyra
Samter Winslow said: “The best of the new live shows is
certainly Stuart Brent, who reviews books, and books
only, daily Monday through Friday, on WOR-TV....
His style is easy, intimate, calm, interesting. Who knows?
He may give just the fillip needed to cause a renaissance
of reading by the home girls. And about time, too!”</p>

<p class='c014'>In Chicago, Paul Molloy, the <i>Sun-Times</i> columnist,
who had followed this apparent breakthrough with great
enthusiasm, commented on the record of 2,700 letters
received during the first four weeks of the broadcasts.
“More interesting,” he said, “than the plaudits, however,
is the fact that Brent went out on his own and sold the
show because he’s convinced there’s a market for it. Most
broadcasters aren’t, but they’ll have to come around to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>it. For 2,700 letters in four weeks is a lot of reaction.
Even The Untouchables doesn’t touch this record. For
my part, I find Brent the most scholarly and at the same
time most down to earth teletalker in Chicago today. I’ve
yet to leave one of his shows without having learned—or
at least thought—something.”</p>

<p class='c014'>But in spite of all the good sendoffs, TV syndication of
Books and Brent failed to pick up the additional sponsorship
necessary to make it a going concern. Hal Phillips,
program director of KHJ-TV in Los Angeles, wrote:
“After much discussion and consideration, we have determined
that we will not be continuing with the ‘Books and
Brent’ series after Friday, December 2, 1960. This in no
way reflects upon our feeling of the top quality and standard
of the program. The decision is based upon the lack
of sales potential, etc. We have liked this series and have
had fine viewer response from it and regret that we will
have to discontinue these programs.”</p>

<p class='c014'>This time, when my venture crumbled, I did not feel
affected too deeply. I continued with my daily broadcasts
from WBKB, fully prepared to accept their demise
also. By this time I had a realistic sense of the pressures
to which this industry is subject, and I knew this was a
world in which I could not afford to get involved. At the
end of my third successive year, the rumors began to circulate.
Then Danny Schuffman dropped a hint at lunch
one day. Danny has been carefully schooled in the diplomacy
of the television jungle and unless you were
listening with a third ear you would probably never catch
the veiled meaning of the innocent remark.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>After all, while nobody questioned the public service
value of the show, the fact remained that the “rating” was
at a standstill and there was apparently no possibility of
getting a sponsor. At the same time that an estimated
20,000 were viewing me, 46,000 were supposed to be
watching something on another channel, 61,000 on another,
and 70,000 on still another. The competition must
be met. The parent company in New York wants higher
ratings. The stockholders want higher profits. Five days
a week is too much exposure anyway. Books and Brent
has had it. In a world about equally divided between
those who are scared to death and those too bored to do
anything anyway, the soundness of these operational judgments
can scarcely be questioned.</p>

<p class='c014'>When, finally, Red Quinlan got around to telling me all
about this, I knew what was coming and offered no objections.
It would have been inconceivable for us to part except
as friends. And my mild, husbandly trepidation
about breaking the news to Hope proved utterly groundless.
She was simply delighted.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the last weeks of my daily broadcasts, I planned
every show with the greatest care and instead of reviewing
new and popular fiction and non-fiction, I chose the
most profound works that I felt capable of dealing with.
In succession, I talked on Mann’s <i>The Magic Mountain</i>,
Proust’s <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>, Joyce’s <i>Ulysses</i>,
Kafka’s <i>The Trial</i>, Camus’ <i>The Stranger</i>, Galsworthy’s
short story, <i>Quality</i>, Northrop’s <i>Philosophical Anthropology</i>,
Hemingway’s <i>The Old Man and the Sea</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>,
<i>Job</i>, <i>Faust</i>, and <i>Peer Gynt</i>, Fromm’s <i>The Art of Loving</i>,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>Erickson’s <i>Childhood and Society</i>, Huxley’s <i>Brave New
World</i>, Dostoevski’s <i>Crime and Punishment</i>; <i>Four Modern
American Writers</i>, and Stendahl’s <i>The Red and the
Black</i>. It was a pretty wild course in Western literature
and the results were astounding, not only in viewer response,
but also in the run on these books experienced by
bookstores throughout the city and the suburbs.</p>

<p class='c014'>Demand was particularly sensational for Father du
Chardin’s <i>The Phenomena of Man</i>, also included in this
series. A check of bookstores in the area showed sales or
orders of approximately 900 copies in a single day. Over
2300 copies of this one title were sold in less than one
month. Our shop sold almost 600 copies. A. C. McClurg’s
reported: “We had 375 copies of <i>Phenomena of Man</i> on
hand before Brent’s review. By 3:30 that afternoon we
sold them all and wired Harper and Brothers for 500
more.” McClurg’s had moved only 150 copies of the
book during the previous five months.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I reviewed <i>The Red and the Black</i>, we had only
ten copies in stock at the shop (in the Modern Library
edition) and sold them out immediately. We tried picking
up more from McClurg’s, but they too were sold out.
I then called one of the large department store book sections
to see how they were doing. The clerk who answered
the phone said, “No, we don’t have a copy in stock. We’re
all sold out.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Was there a run on the book?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, as a matter of fact there was.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Can you tell me the reason?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes, you see they’ve just made a movie out of the book.”</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>He almost had me persuaded until I checked the theatres.
There was no such movie—not playing Chicago,
anyway.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since I continually counseled men and women to accept
life, to live it, to change themselves if necessary, but
never to turn against creation or to abandon love and
hope, never to fall for the machine or the corporation or
to look for Father in their stocks and bonds, I was hardly
in a position—even armed with the facts and figures—to
try to fight the organization for the saving of Books and
Brent. I did, however, two weeks before the series ended,
take the audience into my confidence and explain the situation
as fairly as I could. Mr. Quinlan had my talk
monitored and agreed that I handled the matter with
sincerity and truthfulness. There was nothing Red could
do—he was tied to an organization that was too impersonal
to respond to the concerns of a mere 20,000 people.
We understood each other perfectly on this score.</p>

<p class='c014'>But what happened after my announcement was something
neither of us ever expected, even though we knew
there were some people out there who bought books and
wrote heartwarming letters. Phone calls began coming
into the studio by the hundreds, letters by the thousands.
One late afternoon, Red called me and said, “I knew you
were good, but not that good. I just got a call from the
asylum at Manteno protesting your cancellation. Even
the madmen like you.” We both laughed but we were
touched, too.</p>

<p class='c014'>Letters, telegrams, and even long distance phone calls
began to plague the chairman of the board in New York
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>City. Letters by the score were sent to Mr. Minow in
Washington. But the most beautiful letters were those
directed to Hope and me, on every kind of paper, written
in every kind of hand, some even in foreign languages.
Until this has happened to you, it is impossible to imagine
the feeling. The meaning of a mass medium strikes you
and all at once it seems worthwhile to cope with the whole
shabby machinery if you are able to serve through it.</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope and I sat reading every bit of mail late into the
night. She said: “Do you remember telling me what
F. Scott Fitzgerald said?” I looked puzzled. “He said that
America is a willingness of the heart,” she prompted.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have indicated that Red Quinlan is a man who knows
his business and his way around in it, and that he is also
a man deeply enamored of the world of letters. He was
even less ready than I to call it quits. He invited me to
lunch one day, and after pointing out that, anyway,
for the sake of my health the five-day-a-week grind was
too much of a strain to be continued, he asked, “But how
about once a week at a good hour with a sponsor?”</p>

<p class='c014'>I hesitated. The columnists had broken the story of
my demise at WBKB. Another station had shown interest
and we had had preliminary talks. But the fact was,
I couldn’t have asked for better treatment than WBKB
had given me. Nobody ever told me what to do or how
to slant my program. The crew on the set could not have
been more helpful. I felt at home there. And while Hope
had at first been concerned about the possibility of our
lives being wrecked by the awful demands television exacted,
she was now beginning to worry about the people
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>who wrote in, telling about the needs that my show somehow
ministered to. When Red sold the show on a weekly
basis to Magikist, a leading rug cleaning establishment,
there was really no doubt about my decision. When I met
Mr. Gage, the president of the corporation, he said, “If my
ten year old daughter likes you and my wife likes you,
that’s enough for me. I’m sure everybody will like you.
And we’ll try very hard to help you, too.” If you can just
get that kind of sponsor, things become a good deal
easier. But somehow, I do not think the woods are full of
them.</p>

<p class='c014'>Quinlan’s interest in conveying through television some
of the excitement of the world of books and ideas also resulted
in an interesting experimental program called
“Sounding Board,” in which I was invited to moderate a
panel of literary Chicagoans in a monthly two-hour late-evening
discussion on arts and letters. Our regular panel
consisted of Augie Spectorsky, editor of <i>Playboy Magazine</i>;
Van Allen Bradley, literary editor of the <i>Daily
News</i>; Fannie Butcher, literary editor of the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>;
Hoke Norris, literary editor of the Chicago <i>Sun-Times</i>;
Paul Carroll, then editor of the experimental
literary magazine, <i>Big Table</i>; Hugh Duncan, author, and
Dr. Daniel Boorstin, professor of American history at the
University of Chicago. They were fine discussions and we
kept them up for six months, but nobody would pick up
the tab.</p>

<p class='c015'>My approach to television performance, being untutored,
is probably quite unorthodox. I do not work from
notes. In preparation, I first read the book, then think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>about it, seeking connective links and related meanings.
In the actual review of the book, I quite often stray into
asides that assume greater importance than the review itself.</p>

<p class='c014'>I never say to myself: this is the theme, this is the middle,
this the end. I say: get into the heart of the book and
let your mind distill it, and, as often happens, enlightening
relationships with other books and ideas may develop.</p>

<p class='c014'>I cannot perform in a state of lassitude. Before the
cameras, I always find myself tightening up until the floor
manager signals that I’m ON. For a moment, I am all
tenseness, realizing that people are watching me, but in a
few minutes I have forgotten this and am thinking about
nothing but the book and the ideas I am talking about.
Now I am carried by the mood and direction of thought.
If I want to stand, I stand; if I want to sit, I sit; if I want
to grimace, I grimace. Nothing is rehearsed or calculated
in advance. All I can do is unfold a train of thought
springing from the study that has preceded performance,
and the toll is heavy. Sometimes after the show, I can
barely straighten up, or I may be utterly dejected over
my inability to say all I should have said. Then I leave the
studio, moody and silent.</p>

<p class='c014'>I never talk to anyone before a show except my director.
He understands me and knows how easily I’m thrown.
It can be a slight movement from the boom man or a variation
in the countdown signal from the floor manager,
something unexpected in the action of a camera man or a
slight noise somewhere in the studio, and I react as though
someone threw a glass of water in my face. Then I am off
the track, floundering like a ship without a rudder.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>Sometimes I can right myself before the show is ended, sometimes
not. Hence the frequent depression, for I feel that
every show must be the best show possible, that “off” days
are not permitted, and that I can never indulge myself in
the attitude of, “Oh well, better one next time.” When
people are watching and listening, you must perform, and
perform your best.</p>

<p class='c014'>Often my grammar goes haywire. I know better, but I
can become helpless against the monster known as time.
I have to fight time. I cannot hesitate or make erasures.
So I plunge on, hoping that some one significant thought
may emerge clearly—some thought perhaps as vital as
that which animates the pages of <i>The Phenomena of Man</i>,
calling on us to recognize the eternal core of faith and
courage: Courage to rebel and faith in the realization of
our own being. Courage that takes the self seriously; faith
that is grounded in activity.</p>

<p class='c015'>I hesitate to make any predictions about the future of
television, as a means of communication or as a business.
As a business, it must be run for profit. The argument is
not about this point, but about the level of operation from
which such profit shall be sought. From personal experience,
I can say that TV does not have to constitute a blow
to life itself. Perhaps many of us are “mindless in motion”
and now sit “mindlessly motionless” in front of our TV
sets. But I take heart in the certain knowledge that many
men and women are not so much concerned with the
camera eye as they are in finding a way back to the inward
eye.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>12</span><br>Life in the Theatre</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There are even odder ways of life than sitting alone
behind a desk in a little room lined with books waiting
for someone to come in and talk with you, or delivering
sermons on literature to the beady red eyes of a television
camera. One of them is the theatre.</p>

<p class='c014'>You may recall the scene in Kafka’s <i>The Trial</i> in which
K meets the Court Painter and goes to this innocuous
madman’s room, ostensibly to learn more about the Judge
who is to sit at the trial. The room is so tiny, K has to
stand on the bed while the Painter pulls picture after picture
from beneath this lone article of furniture, blows the
dust off them into K’s face, and sells several to him. Although
the reader recognizes from the beginning that it is
all a tissue of lies and deception, K leaves feeling satisfied
that at last he has someone on his side who will put in
a “right” word for him. It is evident to what ends K will
now go to bribe, cheat, blackmail, be made a total fool of,
in the hope of getting someone to intervene in his fate.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>In addition to its comment upon a culture that would
rather surrender identity than face up to its guilt, the
scene is terribly funny, as well as terribly humiliating.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is this scene that always comes to mind when I think
of the nightmare of nonsense I lived through in the course
of three weeks in the theatre. It happened one summer
a few years ago when Hope and I had come down from
Bark Point to check on the shop. I was answering a pile of
letters when the phone rang. It was a man I had met sometime
before who turned out to be business manager of a
summer stock theatre operating in a suburb northwest of
Chicago. He wondered if I would like to play a lead opposite
Linda Darnell in the Kaufmann and Hart comedy,
<i>The Royal Family</i>. The role was that of the theatrical
agent, Oscar Wolfe, who theoretically functioned as a sane
balance to a family of zany, childish, totally mischievous
grown-ups (roughly modeled on the Barrymore clan).</p>

<p class='c014'>Hope, who had grown up in Westchester society, admitted
that when she was a girl attending summer theatre
it had always been her secret wish to be a part of it. She
thought it might be good fun, even though I had never
acted in my life. So the business manager came over and
I signed the contract, calling for a week of rehearsal and
two weeks of performance.</p>

<p class='c014'>Summer theatre around Chicago cannot be classified as
an amateur undertaking, although part of its economics is
based on utilizing large numbers of young people who
want the “training” and generally avoiding the high costs
involved in regular theatrical production. But top stars
and personalities are booked, the shows are promoted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>the public as professional offerings and are reviewed as
such by the theatrical critics, and the whole enterprise is
regarded as essential to the vitality of a “living theatre.”
The outfit I signed up with was an established enterprise
and, as a matter of fact, is still going. I was not entirely
confident that I could deliver, but I had no doubt that I
was associating myself with people who could.</p>

<p class='c014'>The theatre itself was not a refashioned barn or circus
tent set-up, but an actual theatre building, restored from
previous incarnations as a movie and vaudeville house. I
arrived on a lovely August morning but inside the theatre
was in total darkness except for some lights on the stage. I
made my way timidly down front where a number of people
were sitting. Several nodded to me, and I nodded
back. Presently a tall man got up on the stage and announced
that he was going to direct the play. He said,
however, that Miss Darnell had not yet arrived and, also,
that there were not enough scripts to go around. We
would begin with those who had their parts.</p>

<p class='c014'>For the next three days, I sat in the darkness from nine
in the morning until five in the afternoon. No one asked
me to read, no one asked me to rehearse, practically no
one talked to me at all. I managed a few words with Miss
Darnell, who was gracious and charming, but I was beginning
to wonder when I would be asked to act. Hope had
been working with me on my lines, but it is one thing to
know lines sitting down and quite another to remember
them while trying to act and give them meaning before
an audience.</p>

<p class='c014'>I began to suspect that something was haywire. A
friend who taught drama at a nearby college and often
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>took character roles in stock confirmed my fears by assuring
me that this play would never get off the ground. “It
will never open,” he said.</p>

<p class='c014'>We were to open on a Monday. It was already Friday
and I had been on stage exactly once and nobody yet
knew his part—I least of all. In addition to my fears, I
was beginning to feel slighted. I wondered what I was
doing in this dark, dank place, and what the rest thought
they were doing, including the innumerable young men
and women between sixteen and twenty years of age who
were ostensibly developing their knowledge of the theatre
through odd jobs such as wardrobe manager, program
manager, etc. There didn’t seem much to manage and I
wasn’t sure it was really a very healthy environment. By
this time, a fair number of the cast had taken to screaming,
which is something I am not used to among grown-ups
for any extended period. I also had my doubts about
a young man who spent most of his offstage moments
sweet-talking a bulldog. I wondered if acting necessarily
precluded any kind of emotional responsibility.</p>

<p class='c014'>Saturday night the play preceding us closed. We rehearsed
all that night. Sunday the theatre would be dark,
and Monday <i>The Royal Family</i> was to go on. The Saturday
night rehearsal was initially delayed because one of
the principals could not be found. Finally he was located,
dead drunk, in a local tavern. It was now almost one a.m.
and not even a walk-through with script in hand had yet
been attempted. Instead the company was engaged in a
welter of screeching, shouting, confusion, and recriminations.
This was sheer, silly nonsense I decided, and went
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>to see the business manager. I told him I’d be pleased to
quit and offered to pay double my salary to any experienced
actor he could get to replace me. I was at once
threatened with a lawsuit.</p>

<p class='c014'>At two in the morning, everyone was called on stage by
the director, who made a little speech saying that he was
just no longer able to direct the play, he couldn’t pull it
together! At this, Miss Darnell walked off the stage, saying,
“This play will not open on Monday or Tuesday or
ever, unless something is done immediately.” After all,
she had a reputation to uphold.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thereupon, the director returned with a further announcement.
It so happened, he said, that a brilliantly
gifted young New York director was “visiting here between
important plays” and he had consented to pull the
play together for us! Our gift of Providence then stepped
forward and we began to rehearse.</p>

<p class='c014'>When my cue came and I offered my lines, the new
director said: “The Oscar Wolfe part is really just an afterthought.
The show will play just as well without the Wolfe
character appearing at all.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Fine,” I said, but pandemonium had already broken
loose as the former director and some of the actors took issue
with this new twist. We were already missing one
actor and now this new director wanted to sack me. Well,
I had asked for it, but Miss Darnell and the others persuaded
me to stick with it. The rehearsal continued.</p>

<p class='c014'>At five a.m. a halt was called and the treasurer of the
theatre asked to say a few words. Under Equity rules, he
reminded us, we were entitled to overtime for extra
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>rehearsal. He asked us to waive this for the sake of the play.
I waited silently to see what the general reaction would
be. It didn’t take long to find out: Nothing doing, play or
no play! I went along with them on that. What I couldn’t
understand was why they put up with all they did: the
filthy little cubicles that served as dressing rooms, the rats
and cockroaches that scudded across the floor, the lack of
any backstage source of drinking water—the whole atmosphere
seemed deliberately designed to make an actor’s
life completely insupportable. And now the management
was sulking because the actors didn’t have enough
“love for the theatre” to forgo their pay for overtime.</p>

<p class='c014'>At six a.m. it was decided that rehearsal would resume
at one o’clock in the afternoon. As we were about to leave,
too tired to care any longer about anything, the director
came up and said he was sure I must have misunderstood
him. He would indeed be sorry if I left the show or if he
had hurt my feelings. What he had really meant to <a id='corr174.19'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='say'>say was</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_174.19'>say was</a></span>
that the Oscar Wolfe part lends credence to the movement
and meaning of the play. I was glad to leave it at that.</p>

<p class='c014'>The following afternoon, before evening rehearsals,
Hope and I stopped at a drugstore a few steps from
the theatre. There we found Miss Darnell sitting in a
booth sipping a coke. She motioned us over.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The play won’t open Monday,” she said. “I’ve made
my decision.”</p>

<p class='c014'>We agreed wholeheartedly.</p>

<p class='c014'>“But have you heard the latest?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“No,” we said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“The play that follows us in is falling apart, too. An
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span><a id='corr175.1'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='old time'>old-time</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_175.1'>old-time</a></span> actor in it, pretty well known for his paranoia,
slugged a young actress for a remark she made and someone
else jumped in and put him in the hospital.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“What’s next with our show?” I said. “Has a replacement
been found for our drunken friend?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Yes. He’s busy now rehearsing his lines.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“This is a world such as I’ve never been in,” I said. “I’ve
never seen anything like it.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Neither have I. Not like this one,” said Linda Darnell.</p>

<p class='c014'>On stage, we again worked all night. It was a mess.
The director was in a rage. He scowled, threatened, exhorted.
Everybody was going to pieces. No one talked
to anyone.</p>

<p class='c014'>On Monday morning, we started at ten, planning to
rehearse up to curtain time. But at five in the afternoon,
Miss Darnell told the management she would not appear,
and under her contract they could do nothing but accept
her decision. We went back to work that night and rehearsed
until five in the morning.</p>

<p class='c014'>Came Tuesday afternoon and we were back again in
our black hole of Calcutta. By now we were all more
than a little hysterical and the language would have been
coarse for a smoker party. Some of the players were so
exhausted they slept standing up. But now the play was
finally getting under way. Zero hour was approaching.
The curtain went up and the show began.</p>

<p class='c014'>Opening night was incredible. In scene after scene,
lines were dropped, cues forgotten, and ad libs interjected
to a point that it was almost impossible to stay in character.
The actress who claimed she had played her part as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>an ancient dowager for the last twenty years (“Everywhere—I
even played it in Australia”) forgot her lines
and was utterly beside herself. She said never had she
been subjected to such humiliation. One actor tripped
over her long morning coat and fell on his face. A bit of a
nut anyway, he got up gracefully, muttered some inanities,
and tickled the old dowager under the chin. She reared
back, nostrils flaring. All this time, I was sitting at a piano
observing the scene, feeling like a somnambulist.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the play went on, and although it certainly improved
during its run, the relations of the cast did not.
Every evening we came in, put on our make-up, and
dressed for our parts without saying a word. One night I
lost a shirt. Another night an actress had her purse stolen.
On another occasion a fist fight broke out between an actor
and an actress. Backstage life went on either in utter silence
or in bursts of yelling, screaming, and hair-pulling.
The atmosphere was thick with hostility. But on stage it
was as though nothing outside the world of the play had
ever happened, unless you were close enough to hear
names still being called under the breath. It was crazy.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many of us in the cast were asked to appear on television
interviews to promote the show. A good friend of
mine, Marty Faye, who has had one of the longest continuous
runs on Chicago TV, asked me to appear on his
late evening broadcast. Since the gossip columnists in the
city were already having a field day over the strife at this
well-known summer playhouse, I told Marty (and his
viewing audience) my reaction to the affair and to what
I had seen of the theatre in general. I had no idea I was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>exploding such a bombshell. From right and left, I was
attacked by everyone (including the lady who had had
such a horrible experience playing the dowager) as a
traitor to the theatre and its great traditions. By everyone,
that is, except Miss Darnell and her leading man, who
agreed that something might be done for actors if the
public knew of the conditions under which they so often
work and of the wretched, tragic life they so frequently
have to lead. What a terrible waste this amounts to! No
wonder you have to be virtually insane to pursue a career
in the theatre!</p>

<p class='c014'>Herb Lyons, the <i>Tribune</i> columnist, couldn’t stop
laughing over lunch the day I told him my experiences.
Irv Kupcinet, the <i>Sun-Times</i> columnist, however, whose
talented daughter was among our struggling players,
failed to see any humor in the situation. But the real payoff
came when checks were distributed after the first week
of our engagement. For the week of rehearsals, I had received
the munificent sum of thirty-five dollars, but my
salary for actual performance was to be two hundred
and fifty dollars per week. My check for the first week’s
work was $18.53! What happened to the rest of the
money? Well, in the first place, I had to join the union and
pay six months dues. Then I had to pay the full price for
any seats I reserved for friends or relatives and even for a
seat for Hope. Then I paid for the daily pressing of my
suit and the laundering of my shirts and even a hidden fee
for the use of the dressing room. Finally, there was the
usual social security and withholding tax deduction.</p>

<p class='c014'>But the whole Kafka nightmare was well worth it. In
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>spite of acquiring at least one enemy for life and no monetary
profit at all, I gained some friends who take the theatre
seriously and in a treacherous business, are determinedly
making headway. In addition, Linda Darnell, a
person of great sweetness, has become a cherished acquaintance.
It is not often one comes out of a nightmare
so well.</p>

  <h3 class='c005'><span class='xxlarge'>13</span><br>Writing and Publishing</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>I knew she was crazy the moment she entered the
room. It was a miserable November day, snowing and
blowing, when a woman with a round face, rosy from the
bitter cold, wearing a long raincoat and a hat trimmed
with big bright cherries burst into the old Seven Stairs
and almost ran me into the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Are you Mr. Brent?” she cried. She was fat and dumpy
and she now took a deep breath and stood on tiptoe, running
the tip of her tongue across her lips.</p>

<p class='c014'>“I am,” I said, backing away behind the desk.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Oh, Mr. Brent, a friend of yours sent me. I teach her
children at the Lab school, and she thinks you’re a wonderful
man. And now, seeing you, I think so, too!” She
breathed deeply again. “I have a wonderful book, a divine
book, that will change everything ever written for
children. You must be the first to see it. I’ve brought it
along.”</p>

<p class='c014'>With this, she removed the long raincoat and began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>peeling off one sweater after another. I remained behind
the desk watching the sweaters pile up and thinking, if
she attacks me I’ll make a break for the stairs and yell for
help.</p>

<p class='c014'>Finally she started to undo a safety pin at one shoulder,
then at the other, and then she unbuttoned a belt
about her fat waist. These apparently related to some
kind of suspension system beneath her dress, for she now
pulled forth, with the air of a lunatic conjurer, a package
wrapped in silk which she deposited on my desk and began
to unwrap ever so delicately. She did have lovely
long fingers.</p>

<p class='c014'>As the unwrapping proceeded, her mood changed
from hysterical exuberance to one of command. “Take
this cover and hold it,” she directed, her lower lip thrust
out aggressively. I held the cover while she backed off
and unfolded the book, her eyes fixed upon me with a
wicked gleam.</p>

<p class='c014'>“This book shows something no other book has ever
dared to do,” she said. “It shows the true Christmas Spirit.
Look carefully and you’ll see the new twist. Instead of
showing Santa Claus coming down the chimney, I have
shown Santa coming <i>up</i> the chimney! Furthermore I’m
prepared to make you my agent. I’ll work with you day
and night. Are you married? No? I thought not. My dear
boy, we’ll make ecstasy together and be rich!”</p>

<p class='c014'>It was a delicate situation. I told her I did not think
she should let the manuscript out of her hands, but in the
meantime I would think of some publisher who might be
interested in a new twist about Santa Claus.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Without another word, she wrapped up the book,
pinned it back to her stomach, strapped the belt about
her, piled one sweater on after the other, put on her hat
and raincoat, and backed away like a retreating animal
until she hit the door. Then, still staring at me, she slowly
turned the knob, flung open the door, and fled into the
cold November morning. Her poor soul haunted me for
days.</p>

<p class='c013'>Long before I was known to anyone else, I began to be
sought out by people who wanted to write, or had written
and wanted to publish, or had even gone to the futile expense
of private publication. There was an October night
when I was nearly frightened out of my wits, while sitting
before the fire at the Seven Stairs, by the sudden appearance
of a tall young man with a black hat pulled far down
over one eye and a nervous tenseness that warned me immediately
of a stick-up. His opening remark, “You’re open
rather late,” didn’t help any, either.</p>

<p class='c014'>I remained uneasy while he looked around. Finally he
bought two records and a volume of poetry, but he seemed
loath to leave. He had a rather military bearing and
handsome, regular features. For some reason, it struck
me that he might have been a submarine captain. Presently
he began talking about poetry and told me he had
written a volume that was privately printed. A few days
later he brought in a copy. The verse was much in the vein
of Benton’s <i>This Is My Beloved</i>. He wondered if I would
stock a dozen of them on a consignment basis. I agreed.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>Why not? When he left, he said cryptically, “You’re the
only friend I have.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Months passed during which I heard nothing from him.
Then one evening I saw a newspaper picture of my friend
aboard a fine looking schooner tied up at the mouth of the
Chicago River. He was sailing to the South Seas in it.</p>

<p class='c014'>He came in a few days later to say goodbye. Of course
I had failed to sell any of the poetry, so he suggested I
keep the books until he returned from his voyage. As we
shook hands, he was still tense and jumpy. A few months
later he was dead, shot by a girl he had taken along. I had
just recovered from reading the sensational press accounts
of the tragedy when I received a phone call from the late
poet’s uncle, who said, “I know about your friendship with
Jack and would appreciate it if you would give the reporters
an interview as we absolutely refuse to do so ourselves.”
Before I knew it, I was being quoted in the papers
about a man I had scarcely known and a book I couldn’t
sell. The girl in the case got some engagements as an
exotic dancer after her release from a Cuban jail, but the
affair did next to nothing for the book. Not even a murder
scandal will sell poetry.</p>

<p class='c014'>To everyone who brings me his writing, I protest that I
am not an agent. But often it is hard to turn them away.
There was the little gnarled old man with a few straggly
long grey hairs for a beard who came in clutching a tired,
worn briefcase. His story of persecution and cruel rejection
was too much for me. “Let me see your book,” I said.
The soiled, yellow pages were brought out of the
case, along with half a sandwich wrapped in Kleenex, and
deposited gently on my desk. The manuscript was in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>longhand. It purported to tell the saga of man’s continual
search for personal freedom.</p>

<p class='c014'>“How long have you been writing this book?” I said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“All my life,” he replied. He had once been a history
professor he assured me.</p>

<p class='c014'>“And what do you do now?”</p>

<p class='c014'>A kind of cackle came out of him. “I am a presser of
pants.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“And how did you come to bring this to me?”</p>

<p class='c014'>“I watch you on television every morning.”</p>

<p class='c014'>“Well,” I said, “I’m no publisher, but leave it with me.
I’ll try reading it over the weekend. When you come back
for it, maybe I can tell you what to do next.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Or there was the woman who had written inspirational
poetry since she was ten. She had paid to have one volume
of verse printed, and now she had another. “This volume
is for my mother,” she said. “She is very sick. If I could
get it published, I think it would help her. But I don’t
have the money to pay for it.” And her voice trailed away
into other worlds. She worked nights at a large office
building. During the day, when she wasn’t caring for her
sick mother, she wrote poetry.</p>

<p class='c014'>“May I see it, please?” And now I was stuck. “Leave
it with me. I’ll see what I can do.” Of course I could do
nothing. But how could I tell this fragile, helpless creature
that even great poetry is unlikely to sell two thousand
copies? I recalled Dr. Frieda Fromm-Reichmann
once saying to me: “A good analyst must always have a
rescue fantasy to offer.” But I am not an analyst, rabbi,
priest, or even a Miss Lonelyhearts.</p>

<p class='c014'>A young man, hate and rebellion written terribly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>across his face, accosted me unannounced and declared:
“I’ve watched you on TV. You sound like a right
guy. Here’s my book. Find me a publisher. Everybody’s
a crook these days, but maybe you’re not. Maybe you believe
what you say. Well, here’s your chance to prove it!”
Then he rushed out, leaving the manuscript behind and
me yelling after him, “Hey, wait a minute!” But he was
gone.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not merely the poor and downtrodden or the hopeless
nuts who seek fulfillment through publication. “If
you can get my wife’s book published, I’ll give you ten
thousand dollars,” a wealthy customer told me. Another
said, “Get this book published for me and I’ll buy five
thousand copies!” Another, who had certainly made his
mark in business told me, “If I can get published, all my
life will not have been lived in vain.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Touching and even terrifying as these thwarted impulses
toward expression may be, virtually every example
turns out to be deficient in two ways:</p>

  <dl class='dl_1'>
    <dt>1.</dt>
    <dd>It is badly written.
    </dd>
    <dt>2.</dt>
    <dd>Its philosophic content is borrowed instead of being distilled from the writer’s own
    experience.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<p class='c014'>The second error is also a glaring defect in the work
of many practicing and commercially successful novelists.
For example: the writer who, in drawing a neurotic character,
simply reproduces the appropriate behavior patterns
as described in psychoanalytic literature. The result
may be letter perfect as to accuracy and tailor-made
to fit the requirements of the situation, but the final product
is nothing but an empty shell.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>In any event, a real writer is not just someone with a
fierce urge or dominating fantasy about self-expression.
He may well have a demon that drives him or he may find
a way to knowledge out of the depths of personal frustration.
But before all else, he is someone who has a feeling
for the craft of handling the written word and the patience
to try to discipline himself in this craft. The main thing
to remember about a writer is that he makes it his business
to put words together on a sheet of paper.</p>

<p class='c014'>Beyond this, he may be any sort of person, of any physique,
of any age, alcoholic or not, paranoid or not, cruel
or not, drug addicted or not, horrible to women and children
or not, teach Sunday School or not, anything you
please. He can even engage in any vocation or profession,
as long as he keeps going back to his desk and putting
words together. He can be wealthy or have no money at
all, and his personal life can be perfectly average and uneventful
or utterly unbelievable. Just as long as he really
works at words.</p>

<p class='c014'>The level of his intention and his art may vary from
writing for the newspapers to plumbing the depths of
experience or pursuing some ultimate vision, but within
the range he undertakes, the discipline of words calls
also for the discipline of values, intelligence, emotion,
perception. Writers who are serious about their business
know these things, and the difficulties they present, too
well to have to talk about them. In all my conversations
with writers, I can recall few instances in which anybody
ever talked directly about the art of writing.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the case of professional writers, I have acted more
often as a catalyst than as a volunteer agent. For example,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>I abused as well as prodded Paul Molloy, the prize-winning
columnist of the <i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, until he turned
his hand to a book. The simplicity and sincerity of his style
has an undoubted appeal, as the <a id='corr186.4'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='sucess'>success</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_186.4'>success</a></span> of the book, <i>And
Then There Were Eight</i>, has proved. I am sure he would
have written it anyway, ultimately, but even a fine talent
can use encouragement.</p>

<p class='c014'>I have also found it possible to help another type of
writer—the expert in a special field who is perfectly qualified
to write a type of book that is greatly needed. During
the period when my psychiatric book speciality was
at its peak, I became aware of the need for a single giant
book on the whole story of psychiatry. Dr. Franz Alexander,
then Director of the Chicago Institute for Psychoanalysis,
was the obvious choice for such a monumental
undertaking. No other great authority was so widely respected
outside his particular field—not only among
those in other “schools” of psychiatric thought, but among
workers and scholars in every area concerned with the
human psyche.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dr. Alexander was the very first student at the Institute
of Psychoanalysis founded by Freud in Vienna. I loved
to listen to Dr. Alexander reminisce about his relationships
with Freud and the original Seven and especially
admired his view of the relationship of modern psychoanalysis
to Spinoza’s philosophy of the emotions. He was
one of the few men I had encountered in this field who
had a thorough background in philosophy. When I
broached the idea of a monumental compendium, embracing
the total field of psychiatry and psychoanalysis,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>historically and technically, he at first hesitated, then
finally agreed—if the right publisher could be interested
and if a fairly large advance could be obtained to help
with the extensive research that would be involved.</p>

<p class='c014'>Shortly thereafter, while on a trip to New York, I
had lunch with Michael Bessie of Harper and Brothers
and explained the idea to him. He was very much taken
with it, and within a few weeks all of the details were
worked out to Dr. Alexander’s satisfaction. The work is
still in progress, Dr. Alexander having retired to California
to devote the greater part of his time to its completion.</p>

<p class='c014'>Other books which I also managed to place for Chicago
analysts were Irene Josslyn’s <i>The Happy Child</i> and
George Mohr’s <i>Stormy Decade, Adolescence</i>.</p>

<p class='c014'>But what of the young man or woman who has determined
to devote himself to the difficult craft of writing,
who has beaten out a book to his best ability, and is looking
for a publisher? What do you do?</p>

<p class='c014'>Well, of course, there is nothing to prevent you from
bundling up your manuscript and mailing it to various
publishers. Experience shows, however, that very few
manuscripts submitted “cold” or, in the trade phrase, “over
the transom” (obviously the mailman can’t stick a manuscript
through the letter slot), ever see the light of day.
This doesn’t mean that someone doesn’t carefully consider
the piece before attaching a rejection slip to it. I should
say, however, that something of a very special literary
quality—not the self-styled “advance guard” but the
truly different, which has no audience ready-made and
hence must create its own, the kind of literature which you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>just possibly might write (and which I think certainly is
being written) and that could change the world through
its extension of our resources of feeling and expression—does
not stand too strong a chance of passing through the
literate but patterned screening of publishers’ manuscript
readers. Furthermore, since each publishing house has a
character all its own, the likelihood of any one manuscript
ending up in the right place is a numbers game that can
be quite disheartening to play.</p>

<p class='c014'>Perhaps the best advice that can be given to the determined
author is: Get a good agent. This is not necessarily
easy and there are pitfalls, including sharks who prey
upon the innocent for their own financial gain. A manuscript
that comes into the publisher’s office “cold” stands
a better chance of receiving serious consideration than
one sent under the auspices of a dubious agent. Nevertheless,
a manuscript by an unknown writer usually gets
a quicker reading if it comes through a recognized agent.<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c016'><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c014'>With or without the help of an agent, the task is to try
to place the book with some publisher. This task has become
increasingly difficult unless the book is, by its very
nature, a safe bet to sell. Nowadays the best bets are the
so-called “non-books”—books specifically designed for
selling, such as collections of humorous pictures and captions
or volumes whose authors are not only well known in
the entertainment world, but also carry a heavy clot with
TV audiences: The Jack Paar Story, The Zsa Zsa Gabor
Story, The Maurice Chevalier Story, The Harpo Marx
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Story—they may not all have exactly the same name
and they may be written in greater or lesser part by relatively
accomplished hacks, they may range from the fascinating
to the disgusting in content, but they all exist for
the same reason: there is a built-in audience that will buy
them. Frankly, if Books and Brent had ever achieved network
status, I could have done the same thing.</p>

<p class='c014'>The problem is not that publishers will buy a sure
thing. Of course they will and, within reason, why
shouldn’t they? The problem is that less and less is being
published today that stands a chance of belonging in the
realm of permanent literature. It is easier to get a book
like this published, <i>about</i> books and writers (although
not too popular a subject and therefore a fairly adventurous
publishing undertaking), than it is to get the hard-wrought,
significant works of some of the writers I have
mentioned into print. Actually, most of the material that
is selected for publication today is chosen precisely <i>because</i>
it is temporary in value and appeal. Publishing, of
course, is a difficult business and every book, in a sense, is
a long shot, more likely to fail than to succeed in turning a
profit. Most publishing houses have been built on the
proposition that the successes must help subsidize the
failures, but that this is the only way that the new and
unknown talent, which will create the future of literature,
can be developed. Publishing has never been like most
manufacturing industries, where you can survey a new
line before you try it, and drop it if it doesn’t pay its way.
In spite of all the tons of junk printed since Gutenberg,
the glory and prestige of publishing is linked not with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>numbers of copies sold but numbers of enduring works
produced. Virtually no one remembers the best sellers
of 1900 or even 1950. But the great editors and publishers
who nurtured, say, the talents of the 1920’s have become
part of literary history. A Maxwell Perkins couldn’t
exist in an industry that didn’t care what it was doing or
that wouldn’t take its chances.</p>

<p class='c014'>Taking a chance seems to be a custom that is going
out of fashion—especially taking a chance on something
you believe in. It is strange that this should be so, especially
in business and industry, where the tax laws tend
to encourage judicious failure (“product research,” etc.)
in any enterprise strong enough to be in the fifty-two percent
bracket. Perhaps corporate structure is one of the
factors that tend to close our horizons. A free individual
can keep taking his chances until the world catches up
with him. But the officer of a corporation who is responsible
for justifying his actions to the board (and the board
to the banks and the stockholders) does not have much
leeway.</p>

<p class='c014'>Both good books and bad books sell (and many books,
both good and bad, fail to sell at all). A good book is,
very simply, a revealing book. A bad book is bad because
it is dull. Its author is obviously lying, not necessarily
by purveying misinformation, but because he lards
his work with any information that falls to hand—a sort
of narrative treatment of the encyclopedia. A good book
stirs your soul. You find yourself lost, not in an imaginary
world (like the encyclopedia), but in a world where
everything is understood. Readers and editors alike, no
matter how debilitated, can detect this difference.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>So, even, can the reviewers—largely a group of underpaid
journalists and college professors who have a
right, if any one does, to have become weary of letters.
A writer friend of mine recently told of waiting at an airport
for a plane that was late. He bought all three of the
literary magazines obtainable from the newsstand and
settled down to read. Every book review seemed to him
written by someone who hated literature. He became
utterly disgusted with both the reviews and the reviewers.</p>

<p class='c014'>Considering the volume of publishing, how can it be so
difficult to get good new books? There are not enough
really significant titles coming out for me or anyone else
to make a decent living selling them (I gave up trying
with the Seven Stairs). When I talked with Mr. Simon,
he assured me that Simon and Schuster and the book industry
as a whole were booming with the mergers and
the mushrooming educational market, but that the big
problem was finding good writers and good books. I wonder
if they are going about it properly. Somehow the
prize contests and other subsidies never seem to bring
genuine individual talent to the fore, and while everybody
claims to be looking for something fresh, what gets bought
looks suspiciously like the same old package.</p>

<p class='c014'>Publishing has so often been (and in many cases, still
is) a shoestring industry, that one gets a momentary lift
from seeing it listed today on the board on Wall Street.
But it is an open question whether the investors are supplying
risk money for a cultural renaissance or buying into
a sure thing: the increasing distribution of synthetic culture
through textbooks and the propagation of standard
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>classics and encyclopedias at cut-rate prices through the
supermarkets.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anyone who has given his heart and soul to literature
and the arts is likely to regard everyone who pulls the
financial strings in the communications world as a monster.
But the commercial outlook on something like the retail
book trade is so dispiriting that the wonder is anybody
pays any attention to it whatever or publishes any books
at all whose distribution depends upon such channels.
In Chicago, for example, a center of about six million people,
there are approximately five major bookstores (excluding
religious and school book suppliers). Compared
to this, I am told of a village in Finland of six thousand
people where there are three bookstores doing a fine business!
Now in my own shop I sell books, to be sure, but I
also sell greeting cards, art objects manufactured by or
for the Metropolitan Museum, paperbacks, records, and,
at Christmas time, wrappings, ribbons, stickers, and miniature
Santa Clauses. I still got into trouble one day when
a woman came in and couldn’t get a pack of pinochle
cards. She thought I had a lot of nerve advertising books
and not selling playing cards. Actually, “Bookstore” in
America has come to mean a kind of minor supplier of
paper goods and notions—and that is exactly what the
great number of “Book Dealers—Retail” listed in the
Chicago Redbook in fact are.</p>

<p class='c014'>But you <i>can</i> buy a book in Chicago. Try it, however,
in most of the cities across this vast country up to, say,
100,000 population. You’ll be lucky to find a hardback
copy of anything except the current best sellers. And in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>spite of the wonders of drug store paperbacks, a culture
can’t live and grow on reprints.</p>

<p class='c014'>So let’s face it. In a nation of 185 million people, some
of whom are reasonably literate, a new book that sells ten
to twenty thousand copies is regarded as pretty hot stuff.
In an age of the mass market, this isn’t hot enough to light
a candle.</p>

<p class='c014'>What to do about it? Well, in the first place, let’s not
be complacent about what’s happening to American culture,
to the American psyche. It isn’t just the money-grubbing,
the success-seeking; grubbing and striving,
more or less, are a part of living. It is the emptiness, the
meaninglessness. Nobody can get along without an interior
life. The soul must be fed, or something ugly and
anti-human fills the void. Spiritual nourishment is not a
frill, apart from everyday necessity. The everyday and
the ultimate expression of man do not exist apart. Synge
remarked: “When men lose their poetic feeling for ordinary
life and cannot write poetry of ordinary things,
their exalted poetry is likely to lose its strength of exaltation,
in the way men cease to build beautiful churches
when they have lost happiness in building shops.”</p>

<p class='c014'>In the modern world, good reading offers one of the
few means of getting back to one’s self, of refreshing the
spirit, of relating to the inward life of man. Through
reading you can get acquainted all over again with yourself.
You can stand being alone. You will look forward
again to tomorrow.</p>

<p class='c014'>Anything that stands in the way of this hope for renewal
is an affront to man and a judgment on our times.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>If the publishing industry has found a helpful new
source of income through the present mania for education,
fine. But a few extra years of education aren’t going
to change anybody’s life. If we wait for a popular
growth in “cultural maturity” to justify making more
widely available the sustenance men need, it will come
too late. There must be ways of cutting through the
jungles of mass markets and mass media to reach, in a way
that has not previously been possible, the much smaller but
more significant audience of the consciously hungry. For
as long as there are human souls still alive and sentient,
there can be good books, good writers, even booksellers
selling books again, paying their bills, earning a living.</p>

<p class='c014'>Meantime, if you must be a writer, write seriously and
well. Never pay for publication of your own book. Take
your chances. If you succeed, fine. If not, then you must
either persist in trying, time after time, or give up. Perhaps
the present custodians of culture have their minds
on other matters and do not wish to hear what you have
to say. So be it. You will not be the first.</p>

</div>

<p class='c013'>When I began to read, I fell in love with such a consuming
passion that I became a threat to everyone who
knew me. Whatever I was reading, I became: I was the
character, Hamlet or Lear; I was the author, Shelley or
Stendhal. When I was seized by sudden quirks, jerks,
and strange gestures, it was not because I was a nervous
child—I was being some character.</p>

<p class='c014'>One morning when I awoke, I looked into the mirror
and discovered that one part of my head seemed bigger
than the other. I ate my breakfast in silence with my
three sisters gathered about the table watching me. When
I suddenly looked up, I thought I saw them exchanging
meaningful glances.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you see something strange about me?” I asked.</p>

<p class='c014'>They shook their heads and suppressed a giggle.</p>

<p class='c014'>My mother, washing dishes at the sink, stopped and
looked at me, too.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Do you see anything unusual about me?” I said. She
didn’t.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>I got up and, standing in the middle of the floor, bent
my head to one side and said, “Look, my head is swelling!”</p>

<p class='c014'>My sisters laughed wildly, while my mother cried,
“What are we going to do with this silly boy? What are
we going to do?”</p>

<p class='c014'>My knowledge, they assured me, was coming out of my
head. And I told them this was not funny at all.</p>

<p class='c014'>When I went back to the mirror, I liked my face much
better. The forehead was showing some wrinkles. Lines
were appearing at the mouth. The eyes seemed more in
keeping with what might be expected of a thinker or poet.
Before I had begun to read, this face certainly had appeared
more ordinary—just smooth and clean and nothing
else. Now that I had begun to peer a little into the
minds of great men, something was entering my soul that
reflected itself in my face. I was sure of it. Naturally, the
idea that filling my head with knowledge might cause it
to burst was nonsense, but I certainly was cramming in an
oddly miscellaneous assortment of facts, dates, events,
phrases, words, snatches of everything. I never read systematically.
I read everything, and I think still that it is
simply stupid to tell boys and girls to read certain books
between the ages of nine and twelve, other books between
sixteen and twenty, etc. I got lost in the paradise of books
and it wrecked me forever—destroyed any possibility of
my becoming a “successful” man, saved me from becoming
a killer in the jungle of material ambition.</p>

<p class='c014'>I think prescribed reading is the enemy of learning, and
today it is probably the end of culture. As a boy, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>devoured all the Sax Rohmer mysteries, the Rover Boys, the
Edgar Rice Burroughs’ <i>Men of Mars</i> and the Tarzan series;
I read <i>Penrod and Sam</i>, <i>Huckleberry Finn</i>, <i>Tom Sawyer</i>—all
with equal enthusiasm. This is where it begins.
Taste can come later.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a certain point, once enthusiasm is engendered,
when a good teacher can open doors for you. I had such
a teacher, and later a friend, in Jesse Feldman. His enthusiasm
supported my own, and at the same time he held
the key to the wealth of possibilities that literature offers.
He was a scholar, but his real scholarship resided in his
love for people. He believed ideas could change human
hearts. He inspired me by making me wonder about everything.
He showed me that the worst sin of which I might
be capable would be to become indifferent to the human
spirit.</p>

<p class='c014'>It was Jesse who introduced me to Jack London’s <i>Martin
Eden</i>. I was seventeen. Then <i>Les Miserables</i>, <i>Nana</i>,
and <i>Anna Karenina</i> set me off like a forest fire. There was
no stopping me. I had to read everything. I plunged into
Hardy’s <i>Return of the Native</i> with pencil in hand, underlining
and writing my thoughts in the margins. I loved to
argue with the author and the need to make notations
made it terribly important to own my own books, no matter
how long it took to save the money to buy them. It was
fun to look at books, to touch them, to think of the next
purchase.</p>

<p class='c014'>I read Dickens until I couldn’t see straight. I read
Goethe’s <i>Faust</i> and thought secretly that the author was a
pompous ass. Years later I again read it and became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>fascinated with the entire Faustian legend. This is the way
it should be. You don’t have to get it the first time.</p>

<p class='c014'>I can remember when I first read <i>The Brothers Karamazov</i>
and how it unnerved me. The book created such fierce
anxieties within me that I couldn’t finish it. I had to wait
a number of years before I could tolerate the strain it put
on my nervous system.</p>

<p class='c014'>Later Jesse gave me my first introduction to Thomas
Mann and Jules Romain. I read Henry Hudson’s <i>Green
Mansions</i> and to this day I can’t forget Abel and Rima. I
read Dreiser’s <i>Sister Carrie</i> and loved his social criticism,
his amazing bitterness, his terrible writing. I memorized
the <i>Ode to the West Wind</i> and began my Shelley imitations,
adopting, among other things, his habit of reading
standing up. I read Galsworthy and wrote long précis
of his wonderful short stories. My reading was for myself,
my notebooks were for myself, my thoughts and ideas
were for myself.</p>

<p class='c014'>Although I was seldom without a book at any time, the
very best time to read was on Saturday mornings. Normally
my mother baked on Friday and she had a genius
for failing to remember that something was in the oven.
So if I was lucky, there would be plenty of cookies or cake
or strudel left, slightly burned, that nobody else would
touch. I loved it. Then, too, the house was strangely still
on Saturday mornings. No one was home and I could
turn up the volume on the phonograph as loudly as I
wished and sit and listen and read and eat cake. It was
marvelous.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes a single vivid line was the reward for days
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>of desultory reading. I remember first coming across
Carlyle’s remark in Heroes and Hero-Worship, “The Age
of Miracles is forever here!” and how I plucked that phrase
and kept repeating it even in my darkest moments. Again,
after finishing <i>Moby Dick</i>, a book I took straight to my
heart, I began a research job on Melville and encountered
a letter written to Hawthorne that marked me
for life. I was reading at the public library, and as closing
time approached I began to race madly through the
books I had gathered, trying to find something that would
tell me what Melville was like. Suddenly my heart skipped
a beat and I knew that I had found it (child of innocence
that I was, bent on researching the whole world, ancient
and modern): “My development,” Melville wrote,
“has been all within a few years past. Until I was twenty-five,
I had no development at all. From my twenty-fifth
year I date my life. Three weeks have scarcely passed, at
any time between then and now, that I have not unfolded
within myself.”</p>

<p class='c014'>Closing time was called and I went out into the solitary
night, walking thoughtfully home, thinking, thinking,
thinking. I didn’t want money or success or recognition.
I didn’t want a single thing from anybody. I wanted only
to be alone, to read, to think ... to unfold.</p>

<p class='c014'>One year I’d be interested in literature, the next in philosophy,
the following in physics or chemistry or even
neurology. Everything interested me. Who cared what
I ate or how I dressed? I cared only for the words between
covers. I was safe so long as I didn’t fall in love
... this I knew from Schopenhauer. Spengler fascinated
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>me. <i>The Decline of the West</i> was so brilliantly written,
it had a scheme ... and it was such a fraud. But
I was learning how to read and how to think through what
I was reading. I disliked Nietzsche and only later came
to see him as one who was saying in very bald terms:
Don’t sell out! Stop wasting your time predicting the
future of mankind, but become an active part in creating
it.</p>

<p class='c014'>I had long known the Old Testament, but now I became
attracted to the New Testament and the figure of Jesus.
I memorized the Sermon on the Mount and spent sleepless
nights arguing with myself. I went wild over
Tawney’s <i>The Acquisitive Society</i> and Max Weber’s
<i>The Protestant Ethic</i> had a tremendous effect on me and
sent me back to reading Washington, Jefferson, Hamilton,
and Benjamin Franklin. I was beginning to suspect that
I was too deeply influenced by European literature and
not enough by American. Why was I drawn to Kafka and
Mann and Gide and Proust and Anatole France and
Huysmans and not to Howells and Emerson and Whitman
and Hawthorne and Melville and Thoreau? I set
myself a course of study and luckily started with Hawthorne.
Had I started with Howells, I have a strong
notion I’d have given up. But I liked Hawthorne, and
this led to Melville and here I found my God and my
America. His involuted writing was perfect for me and
this in turn led to Henry James. When James made the
remark about the gorgeous wastefulness of living, I knew
he was right. In the eyes of the world I lived in, I was
wasting my time. Many of my friends by now had good
jobs selling insurance or automobiles or were on the way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to becoming successful junior executives. And I? Well,
I was reading! I always worked, to be sure, but at odd
jobs only. If I went to school during the day, then I
worked at night. If I attended night school, then I
worked during the day. But what the job was made no
difference to me.</p>

<p class='c014'>Sometimes I did pause to ask myself where this was going
to lead. There was the day I was being interviewed
for a job at Woolworth’s and the man asked, “What do
you know?” I started to tell him what I knew about the
various schools of literature and philosophy and he
stopped me cold, saying, “You know too much about the
wrong things. We can’t hire you.” This knocked me out
for days.</p>

<p class='c014'>What did I want to be? Did I have to become something?
Did I have to have some land of social approval?
For a time I went around in a state of near collapse. First
I decided upon medicine as a good practical profession
with a lot of good basic knowledge behind it. Then I felt
that perhaps I should be a lawyer. I was generally regarded
as a good speaker and I had an idea that criminal
lawyers were exciting people. Then I thought possibly I
ought to be an architect. But nothing fitted. Finally I
decided. I was going to teach.</p>

<p class='c014'>To my shocked amazement, I discovered that all my
years spent at college, all my study, the range of knowledge
I had sought to embrace, meant absolutely nothing
in the eyes of the master educators. I was deficient in what
were called Education Courses. There was nothing for
me to do but to take them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>In all my life in the classroom, I had never encountered
such a waste of time, such stupidity, such a moral outrage!
The courses were insipid and the teachers themselves
knew nothing whatever. It was either insane nonsense
or an organized racket from top to bottom: courses
on the theory of education (I had already gotten my theory
from Samuel Butler and George Meredith, neither
of whom the educators seemed to have heard of), courses
on educational psychology (something completely occult),
courses on techniques, courses on I.Q. measurements,
courses on the art of choosing a textbook. By the
time I had finished my required work in education, I
could not have been less inspired to be a teacher. I had
heard a great deal about the smug middle class and their
valueless world, and have since encountered them and it,
but I shall be happy to exhibit any group of typical specimens
of this order as examples of vibrant living and exciting
intellect compared to a meeting of “educators.”
No wonder books are dying!</p>

<p class='c014'>In those depression days, it seemed to me that the education
world was something invented to keep some
walking zombies busy. But it turned out that the educators
got in on the ground floor of a good thing. With the
present hue and cry for education and more education,
their job is cut out for them: tests and more tests, techniques
and more techniques.</p>

<p class='c014'>We don’t need more educators; we need more <i>teachers</i>.
And especially teachers of literature. Not teachers who
are smug in their learning and want to impose value
judgments on others. But teachers who are alive with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>love and enthusiasm, whose own experience with art and
letters has made them a little less ashamed to be members
of the human race. Not teachers armed with a book list,
but with a personal addiction to reading as a never ending
source of generous delight. Not experts in testing and
guidance, but people with enough faith in youth to inspire
them to find their own way and make their own choices,
to taste the exhilaration of stumbling and bumbling on
their own amid all the wonders and ups and downs of the
human quest for understanding. We need teachers who
will stimulate, provoke, and challenge, instead of providing
crutches, short cuts, and easy directions. There is just
no point in building all those new school buildings unless
we have more Jesse Feldmans to fill them with the realization
that the aim of education is to help man become
human.</p>

<p class='c015'>I seldom go back to where the Seven Stairs used to be.
It is hard to visualize it as it once was. The old brownstone
has a new face, the front bricked up and the door
bolted. Business is good on the Avenue, but many of the
people who come in seem tight-lipped and hurried. The
Seven Stairs is not there either.</p>

<p class='c014'>But when we start looking up old places, it means we
have forgotten them as symbols. The Seven Stairs was an
adventure of the heart ... a personal search for the
Holy Grail, a quest that still continues. Each step up the
stairs has brought crisis and someone to help me overcome
that crisis and move on to the next. And seven being
an enchanted number and stairs moving inward and outward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>as well as upward and downward, the ascent is unending,
and every step a new beginning, where we must
stand our ground and pay the price for it.</p>

<p class='c014'>There is a Seven Stairs lurking unbeknown down every
street as there was for me on a summer day, getting off
the bus at the wrong corner on my way to meet my
brother-in-law for lunch and walking along Rush Street,
fascinated with the strangeness of the neighborhood. I
was reading all the signs, for no purpose at all, but one
that said, “Studio for Rent,” stuck with me. I turned back
to look at it again before rounding the corner to go to my
appointment.</p>

<p class='c014'>I met Mel in the kind of restaurant that is exactly the
same everywhere, the same I had been in a few weeks earlier
while awaiting my army discharge in San Francisco,
the same fixtures, the same food, the same waitresses, the
same voices. But as I leaned across the table and began
talking, I experienced a sudden excitement and an idea
generated which I announced with as much assurance as
though it had been the outcome of months of deliberation.
Fifteen years later, I can still see Mel’s jaw drop and his
momentary difficulty in breathing when I told him I had
decided I wanted to go into business.</p>

<p class='c014'>“What kind of business?” he said, finally.</p>

<p class='c014'>I told him that what Chicago needed was a real bookstore.
It seemed to me that I had always had visions of
my name across a storefront: Stuart Brent, Bookseller. I
made him go with me to look at the “for rent” sign, then
together we went to see the landlord—my terrible, mincing,
Machiavellian, fat little landlord.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>We borrowed the keys and went back to see the studio.
Mel didn’t really want to go along, but somehow I had to
have him with me. If the quarters turned out to be disappointing,
I didn’t think I could stand it. But when we
opened the door, the hot, dirty room was magic. As I
looked up at the sixteen foot ceiling, I imagined pretty
Victorian society girls dressing here for the ball. I wasn’t
seeing the room. I had just stepped through the door from
Berkeley Square.</p>

<p class='c014'>“Isn’t this rather small for what you have in mind?” Mel
said.</p>

<p class='c014'>“No, no,” I said, “it’s just fine. Everything is just
fine!”</p>

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
